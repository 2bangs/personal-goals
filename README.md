Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Use Github more often
2. Contribute to Open Source
3. Blog more
4. Increase project efficiency
5. Use the command line & keyboard as much as possible
6. Up my JS Game (patterns, Angular, Node)
7. Learn about testing
8. Foster designer participation in open source projects
9. Make more people smile
10. Learn more about WebGL & 3D graphics
