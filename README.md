2. Contribute to Open Source
3. Write more blog posts
4. Increase project efficiency
5. Use the command line & keyboard as much as possible
6. Get better at javascript (patterns, Angular, Node)
7. Learn about testing
8. Foster designer participation in open source projects
9. Make more people smile
