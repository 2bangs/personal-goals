Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source. 

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Use Github more often
2. Contribute to Open Source
3. Write more blog posts
4. Increase project efficiency
5. Use the command line & keyboard as much as possible
6. Get better at javascript (patterns, Angular, Node)
7. Learn about testing
8. Foster designer participation in open source projects
9. Make more people smile
