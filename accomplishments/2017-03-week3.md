### Week in Review

I didn't do a lot other than SXSW from the list this week, but I did get really inspired on some other fronts and started planning a new podcast series and open source project about CSS classes and design system enforcement. The upcoming week has a lot of events and Im hoping to update some talks and move forward with some book things as well, so I'll need to be extra focused.
