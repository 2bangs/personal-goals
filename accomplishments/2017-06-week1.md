### Week in Review

I've been super busy, and that's why I keep forgetting to do this on time. But lots going on – book editing, blog writing, traveling, best friend's wedding, traveling, conference speaking. I did a good thing though and I set up my travel for the rest of the year. Next week is going to be another big one, ending with my best friend getting married! And all of the festivities to follow.
