### Week in Review

Another full week! This week I used the "focus" to seriously help me focus. I didn't get a ton of writing done for the book, but I did reorganize the outline with descriptions for each chapter which really helped me to think about the book. Despite whether or not I go with a publisher, it's been a great experience talking to people about it.

And it looks like I haven't been super productive, but I really have this week. The writing reorg was a lot to think about and ideate on, and I had to host a friend in town for the weekend. I'm hoping I get more done from my list next week, though.
