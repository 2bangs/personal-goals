### Week in Review

This was a great week! I started a lot of things from the list that will continue into next week. I went out a LOT this week and hung out with my friends as well as some out-of-town visitors. Claudina was in town to plan Sass Conf 2015 with Elyse -- it's going to be in Austin this year! So that's exciting :)

There was a lot of OSD chatter as well -- I spoke to the Memphis Web Workers as well as did a video chat with a bunch of people who hang out in the #opensourcedesign IRC room. All in all, good week. I look forward to next week.
