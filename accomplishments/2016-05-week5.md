### Week in Review

This week was meh in terms of productivity outside of work. I was getting better from being sick, and had off Monday for Memorial day. The three most productive things I did, however, were working on my talk for CSS Day and writing a new blog post about accessibility and attending Hack for Change in Austin!

I didn't touch the UI at all :) and worked all in Node and Javascript. So that felt pretty good. And I really like the blog. Next week needs to be more effective, though I do think I'm starting to string some of these things along.
