### Week in Review
While it seems as though I didn't do much this week, I did start a lot of things. With the help of Ian (@iamcarrico), I started dealing with migrating my sites onto Digital Ocean. I learned a lot about servers, LEMP stacks, and users. Also I did a lot of JS tutorials (finished the Treehouse series) to go over the basics again, and started the command line series. `ctrl + a` gets you to the begining of your terminal prompt :). Fun fact and something I use a lot. 

I also started designing my new blog site -- and I've been holding off on posts because I want to put them on the new site. It's been difficult to find time to focus on one thing at a time, but I'm trying!
