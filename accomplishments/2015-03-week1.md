### Week in Review

This week I started a sprint to finish a project I've been on for months within 2 weeks (before SXSW and leaving for Australia). Also, my cousin was in town and I had a ton of things to do for slide/talk preparations and blog post writing. It was stressful to say the least, but very productive.

I felt like I was really working quickly and efficiently. I also added a Speaking section to my blog and got a Fitbit so I can track my calorie progress based on heart rate and try to stay fit while away from the gym and while around town at SXSW.
