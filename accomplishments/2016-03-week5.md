### Week in Review

This week was huge -- I did a lot, even though it wasn't things I planned per-se. I made a big career decision (to join DO!) and told my coworkers and management. I also talked with Alex a lot about plans for future projects and such. We hung out all weekend knowing I'd be gone all next week. Now I'm off to SmashingConf!
