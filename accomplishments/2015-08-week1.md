### Week in Review

This was a great week! I got a lot done professionally and also spent a lot of time meeting new people in Ausitn and hanging out with my friends :) The 6 hr drive to Houston also allowed me to listen to some really insightful blog posts (I LOVE THE NEW TTS FEATURE IN POCKET!) and finish an audiobook. The weekend ended well, with a boat trip to Lake Travis after a day of building slides and playing with CSS. I'm hoping to wrap up some of those things, like slides, next week.
