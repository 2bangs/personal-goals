### Week in Review

This week has been crazy pants. It's been such a sprint at work getting ready for SXSW. I did a lot of work on the patent library and got myself together for the weeks ahead. I finished my post for SitePoint, did a lot of pattern library work, and cleaned. Then went to SXSW and it sure has been an experience. this update is going to be short because SXSW has already begun and I'm updating from my iPad. Next week I don't expect to get too much accomplished because of SXSW and guests I will be hosting.
