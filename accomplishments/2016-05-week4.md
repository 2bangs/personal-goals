### Week in Review

Ahh I'm super late to writing this week in review! But I was gone on vacation last week in the Caribbean so I didn't get much done (and didn't expect to, really). I was super sick for a lot of the vacation unfortunately and I also left my wallet and keys in the Dominican Republic :( so  it wasn't the best week, but I'm on the mend now! And excited to finish my talk for CSS Day.
