### Week in Review

This week was really focused on DigitalOcean. It was Shark Week, which meant a week full of workshops and activities. They flew in all the remotes and it ended with a weekend retreat to the beach :) I had a lot of great conversations with people and met a lot of my coworkers. It was great! :)
