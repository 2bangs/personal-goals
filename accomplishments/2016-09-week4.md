### Week in Review

I spent the week in Bucharest, Romania -- giving a talk at SmartWeb, exploring the city, and working. I also outlined a book I want to write and a new talk I want to give. I know this is a short review but the jet lag is real :P Onto the next week, where I want to focus on finishing the talk!
