### Week in Review

This week I was a little frustrated because Gitbook, which I'm writing my book on is totally not responsive to the issues I'm having with it and completely unusable. It's really hindering my progress. Good things were that I finished reading a lot of books and did a bit of illustration for technical concepts. I realized that I actually really love doing this -- making complex concepts more understandable and want to do more in the future :)
