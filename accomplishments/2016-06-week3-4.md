### Week in Review

The past two weeks have been absolutely incredible, but certainly less productive in terms of dev work outside of work. I've been living and working remotely in Portugal! :) And that means that in the morning, from 9AM - 2PM, I was exploring the city. From 2PM - 10PM I was working. And at 10PM I got dinner (usually out -- it kind of turned into a foodie trip). Anyway, this meant that a lot of the time I usually spend on my own/outside of work writing blog posts or doing dev experiment work was eliminated.

I don't really regret any of that, though because it was really a (mind if I say magical?) experience. I learned a ton about wine and had a really beautiful time. Now its time to get back to it :)
