### Week in Review

This week was also crazy. To be honest, I would have prefered to have time to breathe after SXSWi but my friend was in town and I had to entertain/ host. I never had a chance to really relax and get myself back together before leaving for Australia (so I did a really bad job packing and sort of forgot a couple of things, namely all of my scarves, jewelry, and eyeshadoe :X). I'm on the airplane now about to take off for LAX, and I'll have a layover there so hopeuflly I can go shopping to pick up some of the things I forgot. I also have a plan for my long flight from LAX to SYD to watch some videos and get some things done.
