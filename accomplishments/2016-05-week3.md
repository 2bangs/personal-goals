### Week in Review

This week was spent mostly working in Baltimore, and I was pretty productive work-wise. Also, my SmashingConf post finally got published and I spent a lot of time with friends. I'm now on vacation, so I'll keep this short. I don't expect to get a ton done next week, but that's okay -- I'll do what I can, and this list will be more relevant for the week after.
