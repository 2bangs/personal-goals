### Week in Review

Whoo! This week was definitely hard, but also definitely productive. I stayed in a lot to work on the book and I really focused on writing edits and adding content. I also focused on physical therapy and on getting my knee better. I'm documenting my progress on Snapchat now, and I've joined some online support groups that are *awesome* :) It was a lovely week for productivity and I got a new iPad which has changed a lot of things! I love it so much! Way easier to do #devdoodles and lettering on, so I've been getting a bit more creative :D I'm excited about the new possibilities now.
