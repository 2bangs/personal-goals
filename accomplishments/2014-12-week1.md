### Week in Review

I did a lot of things this week -- albeit not specificaly geared toward my list. And I think thats okay :) for instance, I wrote a blog post, but it was neither on Vagrant nor Sketchnotes. I did start the one on sketchnotes.

I also began listening to blog posts, which has really changed my workflow. I learned a lot about how my brain works this week, and am working hard to discover what works best for me to learn.

I did some node-ing and started to build a website for Happy Hack with Express.js and I wrote a bunch of holiday cards. I now have a bunch of ebooks to turn into audio books for my commute :)

As far as last weeks theme, yeah I do feel better :) Oh and most importantly my serve is now on Digital Ocean!
