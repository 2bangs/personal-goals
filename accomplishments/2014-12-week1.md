### Week in Review

Listening to blog posts and ebooks has really changed my workflow. I learned a lot about how my brain works this week, and am working hard to discover what works best for me to learn. Since I have trouble comprehending long blocks of text (who doesn't?), I started listening to the text as I read it -- This keeps me focused on the topic while getting two types of input (text and audio) to help with comprehension.
