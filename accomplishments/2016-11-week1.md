## Things I'll Read/Watch Next Week:

### Week in Review

This week was pretty good! I got a few things finished organizationally, heard back about my book (!!!!), finished a side project (little browser based game to learn CLI commands), flew to Berlin, spent some time here toward the end of the week, and wrote a post on the plane (one that I wasn't expecting to). I'm feeling reinspired this week to build and write and i'm happy for the break I have in speaking after Berlin (no more conferences until March 2017!). I'm hoping to write a lot next week.
