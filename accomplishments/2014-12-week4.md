### Week in Review

I added a "Happy Moments" section to this personal goals repo where I'll record one happy memory per day, no matter how melancholy, I'll find something. I also decided to make an app, still figuring out the name, but where people can log happy moments like this. For now, I just have that folder and a command line alias to add happy moments to the doc from terminal.
