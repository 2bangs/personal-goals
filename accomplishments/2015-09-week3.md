### Week in Review

This week was incredible. I felt like I was in a fairy tale in Belgium. And I ate *so* much amazing food / had a wonderful time in Bologna with some fanstastic techies. :) I feel so lucky to get these opportunities and I really try not to take them for granted. I have so many things I want to do though! And so little time to do them! But ONWARD to Berlin and CSS Conf!
