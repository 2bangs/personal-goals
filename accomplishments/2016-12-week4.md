### Week in Review

Oh no! I forgot to do this week in review! And it's already Wednesday! This was a weird week -- kind of a holiday week and kind of not yet. There was a code freeze at work, and I did a lot of writing. I didn't do a bunch of things from my list but I did find an apartment and did a bunch of things for that and saw a lot of places, so move-in is set up for the new year.
