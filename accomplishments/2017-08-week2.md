### Week in Review

I'm getting really bad at doing this week in review overall online :(. I keep skipping review days and my productivity is lagging because of it it. Due to this, I'm thinking of starting a bullet journal so I can disconnect from the web when I do nightly reviews (that's my ADD kicking in).

Last week was Shark Week at work, which means it was our all-hands and I did less work than usual (but also did less work outside of work :(). I know that next week might be a little stressful because of this. I'm pretty far behind on writing and on talks. I just need to figure out how to focus again
