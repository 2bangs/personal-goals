### Week in Review

This has actually been a pretty great week. I feel like I've finally found some time to breathe. It's been really nice. I did a bunch of pretty cool (IMO) and unplanned things like making my first yeoman generator for Bluemix apps called [Blueman](http://github.com/una/generator-blueman) and I felt pretty powerful being able to do that in a night without much node experience.

I worked out 4 days this week (up from like none last week) and listened to two audio books. I'm giving a talk next week and I haven't been stressed about it. And OMG I FOUND OUT A REALLY EXCITING THING I CAN'T WAIT TO ANNOUNCE NEXT WEEK.

I think it's because of two things:

1. I didn't have to do things I promised to others this week (so I didn't feel the weight of responsibility to others)
2. I'm getting more used to speaking, so it's not as big of a deal and thus less nerve-wracking. A good thing :)

I'm pretty surprised with how much I accomplished this week all while staying not-stressed and sleeping 7 hours a night. I think reading the *Four Hour Work Week* made me realize its important to work smarter, not harder (despite the book being a little preachy).
