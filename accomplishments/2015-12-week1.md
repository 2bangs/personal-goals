### Week in Review

This week I got all sorts of inspiration to write (maybe it was my Thanksgiving week laziness that spurred this). It hit me (on an airplane, as I was writing a technical article) that I am indeed a technical writer. What. That categorization never occured to me before even though I've written my own blog for a while, I've written for SitePoint, Design Open, Net Magazine, and I've been featured on Opensource.com. I'm currently writing for Smashing Magazine and (likely) ALA if I can articulate a blog post. So yeah, I guess you can call me a technical writer. And thats pretty freaking cool.

I also have *so* many more ideas on topics to cover :) and I decided I want to write a book to allow for a longer format to gather all of them. I decided this in a mini "think about goals I want to achieve next year" session. I know its a tad bit early to ideate (well, is it ever, really?) but I think my mantra for next year is going to be "small dreams are boring." :P so much for "slow down and breathe" (this year's mantra was "just ship it").

Anyway, I'm reflecting a little bit early on this week, because I'm on a flight to Paris for dotCSS and just felt like it, tbh. I'm really excited to give my talk in Paris, just need to practice it out loud and see how long it is and see what sections I should cut or keep. I brought the 3d glasses but we'll see if I have time for them.

Update: OMG. Paris is lovely. I take back every bad thing I've said before.
