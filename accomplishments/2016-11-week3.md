### Week in Review

This week was pretty productive for setting up productivity tools! :P I tried iA writer out, did a ton of writing (about 5500 words this week), and did a lot of reading too. Basically I was focusing on writing and working out this week, and was successful at that. One more week (Thanksgiving week!) until I move to NYC.
