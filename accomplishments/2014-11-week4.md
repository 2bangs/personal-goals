### Week in Review

Happy Thanksgiving y'all! I feel like I did a lot of random things but nothing large and sequential. This may be because this weeks theme was "Leftovers," but I've been feeling kind-of scattered. I began reading RRD but didnt finish. However, I came up with a lot of ideas of things I want to do over the next few weeks, such as a 24-day web-visual challenge. I also really want to write a [book](https://www.gitbook.com/) next year. I'm excited to get going into next year and get moving on some fun holiday things :)

P.S. I was also sick this week, and writing this from a Nyquil-induced sleepy state.
