### Week in Review

This week was absolutely astonishing. I took a holiday after CSS Conf AU since I was already so far from home and spent most of it in and around Cairns, Australia and in the Northern Queensland/Wetlands area. I can't get over how beautiful this country is. I did a bunch of day trips and met a lot of backpackers in the process. I went to the Mossman Gorge, Daintree Rainforest, Cape Tribulation, Port Douglas, and even looked for crocodiles on the Daintree River. I also went snorkling on the Great Barrier Reef and explored a bunch of waterfalls in the Tablelands.

At the end of my Australia trip, I flew right to Atlanta, GA to speak at Camp Sass.I had a great time there as well. So after my 2 week Australia/Atlanta trip after 2 weeks of SXSW, I'm ready to get back to work and get shit done :)
