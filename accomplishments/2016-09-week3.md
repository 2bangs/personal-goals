### Week in Review

This was a great week! And full of a LOT of travel. Including layovers/travel-betweens I was in 7 different cities! In 5 different countries! SmashingConf Freiburg was a great event, and my talk went well. It was also really nice to have a little break at home to see family, work, and regroup before heading out to Europe again for SmartWeb Conf. I also built/shared an open source project using caniuse data to build reveal.js components and experimented with blend modes and canvas. I started writing my next talk and did a bit of illustration/ideation for it. Next week: Romania!
