### Week in Review
I think this week turned out to be super productive, and a large part of that was accepting that I can't do everything, and should focus on one topic a week. This week's was my blog. I wrote a few blog posts (3 instead of just 1), though I'm not sure if they'll all get published. Also, I'm designing fully in browser, so I did a lot of design/dev this week (It's almost ready!) and worked on migrating my content to keep the tumblr links working when I move to Github hosting. I didn't do too much on Angular, but I did finish the terminal video series on Treehouse and played around a lot with vim for editing files.

Not code related, it was Halloweek! :D And my team and I spent a lot of time together prepping our space and costumes. This took up a lot of this week's additional time, but we ended up winning an iPad for best space.
