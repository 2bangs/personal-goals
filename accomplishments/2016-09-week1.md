### Week in Review

This was a great week -- I went to Zurich and spoke at a conference here. I'm a bit late in updating this since I'm basically on vacation right now and for the next few days to hike the Swiss Alps (while I'm here :P) so I don't expect to get much done in terms of work next week.
