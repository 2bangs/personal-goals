### Week in Review

What a week :P I did a lot of things before I went on this 3-day roadtrip from Austin to Baltimore (such as implement a camera feature on CSSgram, start making slides for my practical blend modes talk, added HTTPS to my github pages, and recorded 2 episodes of Toolsday, along with making Diffee work with shareable URLS)

But the rest of the week was focused on this trip. I finally made it to Baltimore, and I can finally breathe.
