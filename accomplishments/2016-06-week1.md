### Week in Review

This was a good week -- mostly I'm happy to have my CSSDay talk finished (I can't believe I was so late on that!). But I am happy with how it turned out.

I recorded 3 Toolsday episodes with Dhanaraj, and am starting to focus on JavaScript again! Inspired from the hackathon last weekend, I've been focusing on node.js work -- I'm going through a FrontEnd Masters course currently about building and architecting an API.
