### Week in Review
This week was pretty crazy. I spent a lot of time learning and making. The majority of my development was focused around this new jekyll blog I'm setting up (migrating off of Tumblr) and figuring out the best way to do that without losing all of the existing links. I learned a lot about gulp in the process because I ended up digging into some node modules.

I also focused on my more general goal of using the keyboard less and mouse more. As I traveled home, I found a good workflow and learned a lot of short keys for navigating my computer screen. I capped the week with a half marathon. Yes. I've run 13.1 miles in the past 6 months.. and they were all on Saturday. :P But it was actually really great and I ended up running most of it, finishing only 6 minutes slower than the one I ran in May (which I had actually trained 4 months for). 

**tl;dr: A good week -- I'm working on a new blog and becoming a cli/keyboard ninja!**
