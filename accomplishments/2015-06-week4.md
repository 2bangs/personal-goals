### Week in Review

This week really felt like a creative week. Going to CodeConf was incredible. The conference was really well run and the theme was very on-pointe. They kept the feel of Nashville throughout. The best part was the people I met -- I had some really awesome intellectual conversations at 1 AM with super talented devs and it just made me want to go home and learn all of the things even more. It was a really fun conference in general (the after party and after-after party were great!)

I keep thinking up more and more ideas of things I want to do. So I didn't get to everything on my list, but I'm really inspired with some new ideas. I've been doing a lot of JS learning too - from Redis to testing to more express stuff and JS concepts. It's been good. The one thing though, it that I do need to get myself back in shape after this month of being off-diet from JSConf.
