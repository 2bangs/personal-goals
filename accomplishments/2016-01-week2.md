### Week in Review

I’ve been taking my non-code goals seriously this week -- particularly #5 (my health). And yes, I started a little bit before the New Year, but i’ve kept it up. Without overstraining myself and having it become an obsession again, I’ve been really keen on watching what I eat and working out. I’ve lost 15 lbs so far in 5 weeks (15 lbs less than the last time I was at a tech event! Yay!). Also, I didnt get to a lot of the things I outlined, but I did do some other things like reading up on JS and writing a Medium post. I'm currently writing for a few publications.
