### Week in Review

This was a great week! I published the post on Sass and ES2015, and Sara published the post based on the interview she did of me :) I then went on a really lovely ski trip with friends where I didn't even bring my laptop (which is why I'm writing this on Monday, not Sunday). It was stunning and I feel rejuvenated. Ready to get back down to business this week!
