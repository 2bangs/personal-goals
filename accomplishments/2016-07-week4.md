### Week in Review

What a week of travel! It started in Austin and ended in Argentina :) I was pretty productive though, having started a course and finishing/posting a blog post. We fixed the routes, then recorded a toolsday episode and I dealt with a tricky packing situation. I'm not in Argentina :) and going to search for a workplace tomorrow!
