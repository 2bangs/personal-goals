### Week in Review

Wow, what a beautiful week. I went back to work for 2 days but the beginning of the week was labor day weekend + 2 days vacation to hike the Swiss Alps (as you can tell from last week's short/late week in review). Seriously, its been an amazing trip and its been very refreshing. I'm super excited for SmashingConf Freiburg which is coming up on Monday and Tuesday, and ready to get back home for a few days to sort-of "reset".
