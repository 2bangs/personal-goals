### Week in Review

Despite not doing a ton from my list, this week was very productive. I built a sock search with the Google images API and met with publishers about the book. I saw an opening for a new housing concept and went kayaking and hiking. I did some planning and a lot of JS :) It's fine -- I know next week's list is way too long, but I'll see what to prune down.
