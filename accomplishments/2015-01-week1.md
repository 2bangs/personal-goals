### Week in Review

This was a pretty great week :) I got a lot done, despite it not being exactly what I planned. I started swimming again at the pool and worked out 6 times. While at the gym, I listen to blogs and thats exactly what spurred the idea for Sass Director, which I then came home and created (version 1 of) in a night.

I also built a book case and finally put up all of my prints! I wrote a ton of slides today (like... 34 slides) so I'm pretty proud of that accomplishment too, and got to spend time with some people in the Austin dev community that I hadn't really seen before outside of events :) So that was nice. I also bought tickets to go to San Francisco/Lake Tahoe in 2 weeks! So yeah, it was great.# This Weeks Accomplishments: -- date here --
