### Week in Review

This week was kind of weird. I was sick for half of it (since Wednesday) and didn't feel like doing a lot of things since then. The one big thing I did was finally implement service workers and write about it (that was on my backlog for a bit), so I'm happy with that. Here's to hoping I feel better soon for next week so I can tackle more writing.
