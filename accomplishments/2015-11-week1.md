### Week in Review

This was *such* a packed week! I released 2 blogs, recorded audio for them, and was on the A List Apart Panel on #FEDtalk. I also finished working on the site for Toolsday released it as a podcast. I wish I had more time to write but I am hosting my friend Ally who is running a panel at SassConf later in the week and we're about to go to dinner!
