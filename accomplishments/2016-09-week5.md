## Things I'll Read/Watch Next Week:

### Week in Review

This week was pretty productive in terms of life goals (definitely getting back into fitness and I even found a trainer), but less productive than I would like it to be in terms of other goals. Specifically, I hoped I'd be further along with my talk on image optimizing than I am right now, but its been a difficult week and relationship issues have been getting in my way and making my brain foggy. :( I need to be better and focus on just finishing this talk so I can practice it! I think it'll be really good I just need to sort out the story and presentation.

Anyway, next week thats what I'll be mainly focusing on :P And Hacktoberfest reviews of things.
