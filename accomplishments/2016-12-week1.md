### Week in Review

This week was very eventful for me! I moved into the corporate housing in New York, I had the company holiday party, I explored a lot of the city and saw a few apartments. Things I've been not great about: keeping up with VR pong, getting to some o fmy backlog goals, building things. But this is because I've been spending most of my free time focused on writing. I think next week I'm going to try to mix it up a little and get some work in on side projects. I've been not doing great on those lately and should try to get in a mix.
