### Week in Review

This week was really productive! I launched diffee, a blog post about setting up pa11y on digital ocean, and booked all the things I needed to book for next month. I even finished the defensive driving class I had to take (finally!). I started talks I had been meaning to get started on, and tests out some coworking spaces. I started working out again too!

So all in all, things are going well. I didn't really focus on finishing all the blogs I had been meaning to this week, but I hope to get some of those done this coming week since I have a long drive from Austin to Baltimore ahead of me.
