### Week in Review

This week was a roller coaster, but it was pretty productive. I did a lot of JavaScript tutorials, watched videos, and wrote my year-in-review. I also recorded a bunch of Toolsday episodes and dev song) It was my last week in the office for the year too (also this week-in-review is late because I went to see star wars late last night!)
