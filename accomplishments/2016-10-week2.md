### Week in Review

This week was crazy. The youmightnotneedjs project got a lot more attention than expected and took away from focusing on the talk I was trying to write a bit :/ but I think in the end it was good :) Got a lot of open source work done and also worked out every day. By the end of the week I was gearing up for my San Francisco/Australia trip.
