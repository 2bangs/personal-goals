## Things I'll Read/Watch Next Week:

### Week in Review

This was an incredible week. It was Mixin Conf week and the organizers really treated us exceptionally. I can't even write to describe this. It was the best conference I've ever been to -- so much love! And the entire week was great!

I ended up revamping my talk up quiet a bit and I think it paid off -- the crowd was really attentive and seemed to really like it. I got great feedback, had a really wondeful time (the entire week was wonderful), and I'm definitely glad I went!

I also started to build out my CLI game on the flight home.
