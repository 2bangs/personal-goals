### Week in Review

This week was great, albeit a little unexpected. I'm currently stuck in NY because of snow, with my flight delayed. But I did get to go to Brooklyn JS and I did give a presentation for an IBM event as well as finished writing a blog post/icon system boilerplate. I'm currently trying to find a place to work out of tomorrow before my rescheduled flight.
