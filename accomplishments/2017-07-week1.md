### Week in Review

This weeks goals were writing and walking. I got a lot better at walking and I did a ton of writing! So I'd say I followed those pretty well. Things I did not do so well were prep for some talks I'm giving coming up (because I've been so focused on the book), so I'll have to cram those in tomorrow.
