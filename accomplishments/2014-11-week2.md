### Week in Review
This week, I accomplished most of the things on my to-do list! :) This could be because I narrowed my scope, like I suggested in [this](http://una.github.io/personal-goals] post on this system. I also wrote another post on resources and went to a few commnunity events. I did a lot of calligraphy and actually watched things: I saw the movies Interstellar and Big Hero 6 :) yay.
