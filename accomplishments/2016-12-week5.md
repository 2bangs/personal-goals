### Week in Review

This week was full of moving, chaos, holiday shopping, seeing family, and being very much off of my diet. I did a lot of soul-searching and introspective thinking and made a plan for next year :) I also wrote 2 blog posts and sorted out my vision for the future. I hope to get a solid fresh start tomorrow.
