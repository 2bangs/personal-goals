### Week in Review

This week, I’m writing my entire review with Vim! :) Which makes me super happy. And may be a cause for mistakes here and there. But that’s okay! I’m learning.

I did a LOT of things. Over the weekend I finished designing the [ATXSass](http://atxsass.com) website, I finished designing my new [blog website](http://una.github.io), I publicized that new blog site and posted a new blog post. It was a lot of things. I also made [slides](http://una.github.io/keyboard-ninja-slides) for a talk I gave about Keyboard ninja magics. It was a super productive work week.

I also started taking caligraphy classes in Roman type, and in addition, started practicing pointed pen (not what I’m learning in class) from a book I borrowed from my friend. I’ve decided to do a series of code calligraphy (should I just call it ‘script’ :P and maybe I’ll make prints if I get good).

Open Source Design is something that came back into my peripheral at the end of the week. I discovered a bunch of new resources and my people who are working on it too, which is awesome. I’m excited for the following week :)
