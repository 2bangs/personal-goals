### Week in Review

This week was mostly spent at AEA Seattle, which was a pretty cool experience. My talk went well. It was the first time I had given such a long talk. I usually give 30-40 minute talks and this one was an hour. Being among the speakers there felt amazing. I'm really lucky that I get to be considered among them. It inspired me to get back to writing, too. The hotel was beautiful and there was a desk that faced the water and I loved it. :)

I finished my demo and another talk, so in terms of the week's goal, I did pretty okay. The weekend, however, apart from Friday, wasn't very productive, so I've set aside a whole day next weekend to focus on working on my talks.
