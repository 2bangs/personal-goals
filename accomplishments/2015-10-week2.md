### Week in Review

I did a lot this week. I'm feeling pretty good. Definitely back in the swing of working out (I worked out *every* day this week). Fell in love with pilates, did a lot of dev things, listened to a few audiobooks, worked on my talk for London (and bought all my European flights)! I also finally bought some clothes. Bank account is a little rough right now for that though :P
