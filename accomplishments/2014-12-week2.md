### Week in Review

I think I did pretty good this week. It's also been a slower week at work with the holidays and all, and I'm still stuck in Texas while my other friends have all gone home (none of us are actually from here :P). But I march on! I've been living in coffee shops and thinking up more and more things for myself to do next year. I just keep getting ideas and don't know how to say no!

So I'm going to start a podcast. It's called Caret Club. And I'm thinking about writing a book called Illustrating the Internet. I've outlined it and have some podcast guests thought up. Am I doing too many things?

I did a lot of reflection and thinking about my goals this week. And planning. Here's a little ditty I wrote:

>I think that was my biggest lesson of the year

I'm going to make next year the year I really just build shit. Thats my goal. Fuck it, ship it :) Just do it. All of those fun phrases. I'm going to plan to build, but don't know what exactly since my plans will likely change (just like that Chrome extension I started this week). That's okay. Here's to building.
