### Week in Review

This was a great week! I was in San Francisco for most of it for SmashingConf and also did a few things around Austin (like buy succulents and a few other odds and ends). I attended Elyse's wedding! And finished two blog posts -- released one and will finish the other next week! It's my last week at IBM.
