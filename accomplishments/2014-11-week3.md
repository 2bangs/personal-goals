### Week in Review

I feel like I wasn't as productive this week as I should have been. It was kind of a crazy week (had a series of unfortunate events) but I hope to do better next week. I did, however, give a talk to the JS Meetup in San Antonio that went over great and talked over a lot of ideas with people.

I will do better next week hopefully.
