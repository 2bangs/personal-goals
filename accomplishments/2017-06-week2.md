This past week was really focused on getting rest and getting my knee swelling to go down. I thought I'd get a bit more work done, but I haven't. So this upcoming week I really want to dig into it — focus on getting some talks updates, started, book writing, and finishing an outline for a series I'm planning to film soon.
