### Week in Review

I was really sick (weirdly nauseas) yesterday, so I didn't get around to writing this week-in-review on time. But today is a new day :) I think last week was relatively productive. I've been slacking on the writing though and need to get back into that. Next week will also be the beginnings of my first 25-days project which is focused on mentorship. I'm basically moved into my new apartment, which is another plus, so more time to build/do things and less time on errands. Yay!
