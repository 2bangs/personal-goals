### Week in Review
It was a pretty good week. I learned some fun facts. I.e. $0 in Chrome always points to the selected element and $1 selects the last selected element. And began to learn angular. I set up a DigitalOcean account and submitted my first PR to an open source project. I didn't get to all of the specific things I had planned, but I did a lot of others as they popped up. It was a pretty good week :)
