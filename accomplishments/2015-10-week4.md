### Week in Review

This week was pretty wonderful. I released CSSgram which was met with a lot of positivity. I can't believe how much it was shared around! It made me super happy. (That is, until my Github repos started getting attacked by spam :( this is why we cant have nice things.)

I did a lot of things from my list this week! And a lot of other things that weren't on it too! And I worked out every day! And I'm getting back into a routine which is nice. All of the running around though, has left my apartment in a bit of a mess. I need to take care of that next week hehe.
