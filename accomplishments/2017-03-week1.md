### Week in Review

This week was pretty good in terms of productivity! I set aside a day -- Wednesday -- to really focus on getting my life sorted out in terms of flights and such. That was pretty clutch. I also started using physical/daily to-do lists, which have helped a lot in terms of organization. I also bought an awesome tiny notebook from Muji that should help with that. Definitely going to be more organized with list making.
