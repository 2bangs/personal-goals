### Week in Review

This week was great :) I flew home, saw my friends, had a lot of holiday event reunions. I feel so much better than I did just a few weeks ago. I also started working on learning React and building an app with it. Wes' course was really good for getting a base level understanding, and next week I'll get started building out components. I think it was really necessary for me to have a few days off to rebalance and refocus. Writing my year-in-review helped a lot too. Happy New Years Y'all! Can't wait till 2016.
