### Week in Review

I've felt really lucky this week. It's been a good week and it has been filled with a lot of great people and advice. I'm really lucky to have the mentors and friends I surround myself with.

I got most of the list done this week (more than ever before I believe), and did a ton of other things, too. I won both of my diet bets and made a little over $20 total :) so that was fun.

I also put a lot of things on next week's to-do list, including some open source design work for friends and Design Open. I keep coming up with ideas! Gah! So little time, so much to do.

Speaking of which, that "say yes to every opporunity" new years resolution is about to really test my abilities this week. Well... here we go! Onto next week! Open Source Design being the focus!
