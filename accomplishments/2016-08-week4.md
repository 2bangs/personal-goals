### Week in Review

This week I spent with my boyfriends family in Maine and also working. It was a long week, which started off with my saying goodbye to Austin and packing up my entire apartment. I've been pretty exhausted from it to do much else. I did make a lot of progress in the ES6 course and came up with a new screencast series idea though,, so I hope to do more of that next week. For the most part, next week will be consumed with Front End Zurich, however.
