### Week in Review

In terms of this week's focus, I failed hard. I didnt do much work on side projects. I'm finding it hard to do this kind of work with so much else going on in NY. I went to two meetups and saw friends multiple times this week. I need to refocus and find time to myself, though thats also been difficult because I've been on the prowl for an apartment as well. Gah! So little time so much to do.

Next week should be more chill in terms of work and people leaving town, so hopefully I'll get some more time to myself to do some side projects.
