### Week in Review

This was a great week -- I got back into a "normal" swing of things post-Porto. I'm feeling more productive than I was when I was traveling (mostly because when I was in Portugal I spent my not-working time going out and being a tourist, and at home I spend my not-working time doing other work).

I'm getting through my reading list and building things again, and its feeling pretty good to see how quickly I'm re-picking things up. What I mean by that is: I feel like I "re-learn" Javascript every month. And every month it gets easier to "re-learn." That makes no sense :P I'm tired. Goodnight y'all and have a good week!
