### Week in Review

This was an excellent week! The weekend was particularly productive (I guess the rainy weather helped. It felt (*very* Seattle). This weekend, I updated events on my website, submitted (and got merged) 3 PRs to 3 different open source projects (also I finished Hacktoberfest), I made a logo for CSSgram, finished its website, and added 4 new filters. I also worked on the Toolsday podcast website for a podcast I started with a coworker, Chris, this week.

On top of all that, I worked out *every* day and holy crap, the fitness class I did this morning was insane. I loved it. I think I've found my new church: 10:30 AM on Sundays at Crush Fitness.

I think I'll soon lose my Europe weight :) (I'm almost there!)

Finally, I launched CSSgram today! And within 3 hours of tweeting about it, it had over 500 stars and 300 retweets. I'm overwhelmed by the Twitter love :) And so happy people like it! I was watching the Google Analytics right after I shared it and had people from *all* over the world looking at it. It was pretty awesome.
