### Week in Review

This was a pretty fun week. I feel pretty accomplished because I'm finally sorting things out of Europe and I also got to have a bit of time with my family and friends. I booked a bunch of flights and spent time packing and tying up some loose ends. I'm currently at the airport about to take off for about a month of being in Europe doing various travel and conferences that I've been looking forward to forEVER and I'm SO excited! :) So I'm going to keep this short and focus on getting some writing in for Net Mag before I continue to put that off.

In a few short hours, I will be in London!
