### Week in Review

This was a great week of conferencing. I'm having a wonderful time in London and am really excited to give my BeyondConf talk. Also, I got back from Chrome Dev Summit *super* inspired about the future of the web. It's really rad to see what they're working on over there re: service worker and offline web (and the physical web) :)
