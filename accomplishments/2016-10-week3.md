## Things I'll Read/Watch Next Week:

### Week in Review

This week was lovely. I visited Alex in San Francisco, where he just moved about 3 weeks ago. We did alot of exploring and ate a lot of great food and went to some awesome bars. Some of my favorites were Blowfish for sushi, Lolo for tapas, Zazies for brunch, a theatre in the Mission for ambiance and food, and Lohilohi just overall. Its so hard to choose favorites to be honest!

The only downside to the visit was that there was not much sleep to be had. I woke up at 7 AM every day to start work on east coast hours and we went out almost every night. Oh well. I'll sleep.. later I guess :P 

At work, I finished two projects I was building this month and got them to a state of readiness for hopeful publishing next week (I took off for Australia :D). So hopefully I can explore a bit and not worry about trying to work through the 12-hour time zone difference. I'm really excited for Mixin and to be a part of it next week!
