### Week in Review

Gahh while I did not finish working on the talk I am giving in 2 weeks (yes, I know), I did get a lot of progress done on it. I researched a lot and focused a lot on it. I also picked up my youmightnotneedjs project and focused a lot of time on code again. I also got to catch up with a friend in DC and go hiking :) oh and I've definitely been more active too.
