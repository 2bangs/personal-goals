### Week in Review

This was a pretty good week! I organized things for my book, travel plans, and SXSW. So I definitely accomplished this weeks goal of "get organized & SXSW." I got a great notebook from Muji and a bunch of really cute pens from Jetpens and got my first artsnacks box :) so lots of things to organize with. I also traveled to SXSW and I'm loving the festival, feeling really inspired by some of the talks and sessions that surround the conference. So good week all in all.
