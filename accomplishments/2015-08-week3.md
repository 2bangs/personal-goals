### Week in Review

I didn't get much from the list done this week. I've been having a lot going on in my personal life -- specifically celebrating my friends' engagements and weddings and dating here and there and trying to figure out my travels. So, professionally, I did NOT get much done outside of work at all this week because of that. I will step it up and I need to refocus because next week is my last before my life gets really crazy again.
