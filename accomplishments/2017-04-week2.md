### Week in Review

This week was very much full of working. I basically said no to every social engagement to focus on writing, editing, and practicing talks or writing/touching up my book. To say I'm exhausted would be an understatement. I basically went from work to home to work on other things, spending well over 20 hours on my talks this week alone. Probably more. Anyway, next week will be much of the same :P so little time, so much to do before the May conferences begin.
