### Week in Review

This has been an overall *very* productive week. I spent the majority of it in a week-long hackathon at work and made a pretty badass app for the community radio (called Realtime DJ). I also published 2 blog posts on CSS Image Effects and started writing one more. I worked on my CSSGram Library and also on an outline for my talk in London at BeyondConf. I sorted out expenses at work and finally got to get back into the groove of things after a month of being away. I also started working out every day again :) (oh! And I'm kayaking today with friends near ACL)
