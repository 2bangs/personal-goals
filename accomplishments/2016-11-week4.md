### Week in Review

This week I did a lot of writing but not much else. I took the end of the week and weekend off for the holiday (Thanksgiving), and focused on packing for the following week. It wasn't unproductive, but the productivity was mostly focused on writing. I will get back into the swing of things next week.

And next week will be my first week living in NYC :) and going into the DO office! I'm excited to be around my coworkers and have a permanent workspace again.
