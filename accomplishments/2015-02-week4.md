### Week in Review

This week was crazy and overwhelming and there were just so many things to do! I don't even have time to reflect right now because its busy, busy. I'm joining a new team next month (BlueMix!) and speaking at 3 conferences in the next 3 weeks. GAH. Most of which were just sprung on me. No room to breathe. I'm very happy for my little vacation in between in Cairns (which I have yet to plan -- yikes).
