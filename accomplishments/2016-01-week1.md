### Week in Review

Okay, so I did only 2 things from my list. But in my defense, I should have written a better list this week. I spent a lot of time on unexpected work things outside of work, and I forgot to add some blog duties to the list. I spent a lot of time with friends and on React and I think it was productive overall. It was great minus getting super sick today :X but I'm going to try to be a trooper.
