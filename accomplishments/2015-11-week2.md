### Week in Review

This week was completely consumed by SassConf. It made me a little anxious that I wasn't doing any other work for a bit, but I made up for a lot of that on Sunday (today). Seriously, I've been working for like 9 hours straight in between coffee shops. I had fun around Austin with my friend Ally and with Sass people. I ate a lot, explored a bit, and it was nice to see the community / hang out with some of the ones I never really had a chance to get to know before.

Also, today I did a bunch of work on CSSgram with people, started (finally) putting together my dotCSS talk, created [arttheweb.com](http://arttheweb.com) today. From nothing to a finished site in a few hours. Except it took me ~ 45 minutes of worrying and sending the copy to a bunch of friends to make sure I wasn't coming off as pretentious for collecting my resources in one place :( I wonder if men do the same thing. Then I published the ClassyCSS post I've been meaning to post (which ended up combining some ideas I had for "In Defense of Extends") and made a fun 3D animated CSS cube animation thing.

Tomorrow evening I'm headed to Chrome Dev Summit, so that should be fun. The one thing I didn't actually get to do that I intended to was to practice my BeyondConf talk again. But I have a few plane rides so it'll be fine :)
