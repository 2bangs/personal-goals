### Week in Review

This past week was a really good one, and ended with SXSW, which has been crazy (thus why this is so late). I flew in from SF, finished the Jukebox, interviewed Dan Cedarholm for IBM Asks, coded Tic Tac Toe in CSS, and did SXSW hard. I also was pretty productive working from home for a bit and rewrote my book outline.
