### Week in Review

This week was full of food. Way too much food :P And I did a few things here and there but wasn't super productive (as was expected). I spent a lot of time with my family, which was nice, but I need to focus at the begining of next week to make sure my dotCSS talk is shorter than 18 minutes. Also, prep for Paris and figuring out how best to spend my travel time.
