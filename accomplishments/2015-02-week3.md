### Week in Review

This week was fabulous, fabulous fabulous. I can't even put into words how joyful I've felt all week. A couple of ridiculously incredible things happened:

* I was told that my talk to CSS Conf AU was accepted (I'M GOING TO MELBOURNE AND I GET TO MEET THE AMAZING SPEAKERS THEY HAVE LINED UP. HOLY CRAP)
* I got to chat with Lara Hogan about doing a presentation together at IBM and plan her visit
* The article I wrote on Code and Community was posted to Site Point and got positive feedback
* I've been in touch with the organizers of Peers & Camp Sass

I can't believe how fortunate I've been :) It feels like all of my hard work is coming together!

I also finished two books, started playing with watercolor painting, started planning out my trip to Australia(!), and even had time to go out with my friends to shows and BBQ.
