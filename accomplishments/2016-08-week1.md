### Week in Review

Wow, what a week. I traveled to Argentina, worked a full 4 days, visited Uruguay, gave a conference talk at the first ever CSS Conference in South America, and got fat off Argentinean food. I think I did a decent job in terms of being productive considering the travel (though I am most productive on planes TBH). I worked on Wes Bos' ES6 course and read Practical SVG. I sorted some plans on things I'm working on the following week and proposed a blog post (also launched one last week so its looking pretty good on that front). Now I'm at the airport about to fly from BA to NYC and go right into Shark Week at my company. It's a crazy time :P but I'm making it through. See you in the morning, America!
