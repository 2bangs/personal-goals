### Week in Review

It was my birthday week! I saw a lot of friends I hadn't seen for a while and also outlined a blog post + contributed to SVGOMG.. Next week I'm looking for a coworking space in Baltimore and also hope to watch Wes Bos' series and prepare for CSS Conf AR (as well as finish the Caniuse thing I started).
