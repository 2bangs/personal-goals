### Week in Review

Oof! Apparently I forgot to write my week in review so I'm doing it the following week. The entirety of this week at spent at PEERS conf. I also wrote a blog post that got a LOT of positive reception on Sass pixel art :) which was awesome and made the giving both a workshop and talk at PEERS worth it. I wouldn't have gotten then idea if I wasn't doing research on my way to Philly at the airport on Sass list examples.

Also, my parents came up to Philly and we spent a day exploring the city :) I got to see a bunch of art when I explored it myself too. So it was a pretty good week. A bit stressful because of all the things I was teaching, but good overall.
