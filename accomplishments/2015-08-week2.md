### Week in Review

Its been a weird week. Progress on professional things outside of work was meh -- okay. I did things. I got some slides done. I read some posts. I've been having some weird personal struggles between being a professional and just wanting to be my age. It's weird. I've been a bit sensitive lately about the (not very fun) paradox of just wanting to have someone to cry to and wanting to be strong & independent. I don't know. It's just been difficult.

Work this week was great though -- I just started on a new team and the back-end engineers I've been working with have been great. I really feel a strong mutual respect driving our professional relationship, which is really all you can ask for. We're going to use React to build the microservice I'm working on.

The internal FED Knowledge Share I started has been wonderful! Our small group has grown and we are seriously out of space in the room. I love everyone I work with. So I'll end on that positive note :)

OH! I also (finally) booked my flight to/from Europe, so I'm definitely going!! Will fill in the other blanks as I figure them out.
