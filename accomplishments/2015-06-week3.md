### Week in Review

It was a great weet! I went to Austin JS, where I picked up the YDKJS series and started to read it. I finished the Codeschool Express course -- starting to understand node a bit more. And most importantly, I bought new bike! And I love it so much! The list for next week is looking longggg but I have some flights to catch :)
