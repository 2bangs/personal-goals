### Week in Review

I was very productive this week. I really love working remotely. I did a bunch of things! I re-learned how to set up servers (kind of) and started 2 blog posts. I launched [diffee](una.im/diffee) and recorded some audio. I also spent the entire week with Alex, so it kind of showed me that I can spend time with a person as well as get some work done. It's been really good :) I feel good about it.

I also am excited about this tiny little newsletter I'm thinking about starting up soon called Web Love Weekly. I created a logo for it this week too!
