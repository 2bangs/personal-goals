### Week in Review

This week I actually feel pretty accomplished. I did a lot of code things -- and made an app in Meteor that works on my phone :) pretty cool. But I did break my servers due to permissions again.. which is frustrating. I've been focusing on going over Javascript from the top to really get a grasp on its concepts. I'm also home for the holidays so I've been seeing my friends and playing with my dog :)

Still a lot of planning to do for New Year so I'm keeping the list short!
