### Week in Review

While I did not get through a lot of the things I had planned for the week, I did get ready for, and was able to attend JSConf EU and CSS Conf EU. My talk went really, really well. Despite needing to cut out about 10 minutes for going over my time, I ended up getting a really great reaction. I took one of the big, white balloons off of the wall that were used for decor and talked to the light crew to have them project a rainbow onto it to explain the Munsell color system and how blend modes work. The audience clapped for me several times mid-presentation, which was super awesome and something that had never happened before. It  was a great crowd.

I also got a lot of new ideas this week! So ahh! This is the difficulty. I need to sort out how to manage all of the things I did not get to with all of the new things I want to do. (SO many blog posts I want to write!!) I think next week I'll need to take some time to refactor my priorities.
