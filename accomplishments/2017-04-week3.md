### Week in Review

What an insane week! I have been so busy with talk writing and prep and other writing that I literally needed a mental health day from work. I spent the weekend with a very orderly hour-by-hour plan, but it was good, and it worked out, and I got a ton of writing and practicing done. April feels a bit like a struggle to get through, but my award will be May soon :D so soon! And I can't wait to start giving these talks.
