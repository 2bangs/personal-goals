### Week in Review

I don't think this week was as productive as most weeks I have, but that's okay. I had a lot of fun this week. I spent time enjoying Austin, and I've been focusing on working out more this week, and I think there's nothing wrong with that. SXSW is soon, so I need to get it together in the coming week to be productive before it hits.
