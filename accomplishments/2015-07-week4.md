### Week in Review

This was a really great week! OSCon was alright, but TXJS was wonderful! I met so many people that I admire and learn from online at the after party and the talks were really, really good. I also turned 23 and got to go home and see my family for a while :) It was super nice to see some of my friends from home and my cousin got me the most beautiful Kate Spade world globe scarf :). My parents got me euros. They know me well.
