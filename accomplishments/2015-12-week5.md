### Week in Review

This week was both good and frustrating for me. I kept getting hung up on the app I'm building in React and it felt like I was banging my head against all of the walls. But if I look at the week as a whole, it was pretty good :) and it was a holiday week. I spent a lot of time with friends and family and did finish an entire React course. Maybe I'm just being really hard on myself.
