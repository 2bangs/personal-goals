One happy moment per day, so by the end of the year, I'll have 365 happy moments to look back on :)

Today I played with an Arduino and made an LED light blink when I held down a button. It made me really happy :) and I understand circuits and resistors a lot better now.

Today I caught up with Jeff Rohde (someone I end up seeing biannualy but its always such a joy :) ). This reminded me of my resolution to be better at keeping in touch, so I set up a monthly Skype session on my iCal with him and other friend groups.

Today I went out with my Russian girl friends in Baltimore. There weren’t many people out because of the Ravens game (Ravens > Steelers), but Sasha and I didn’t mind -- we danced like nobody was watching -- literally. And took over the entire dance floor. No fucks, just dancing :)

Today I flew back to Austin from Baltimore and I met two really rad girls on the flight. One had done work for GirlSpark teaching girls chemistry concepts, and the other was a UX designer reading "Don't Make Me Think" -- my favorite UX book.

What really made me happy today was trying out my new skillet and Aeroccino. I think I died and went to heaven with these two incredible new kitchen utilities.

Today I went to the gym and while listening to a blog post, came up with an idea for Sass Director. I came home and built the js, front end, and a logo in a few hours. It made me happy that I was able to go from concept to creation in just a few hours by myself.

Today I bought tickets to go to San Francisco and Lake Tahoe in 15 days (hey, there's nothing like last minute trips!)

At home, I use two pieces of foam board as a base to "extend my desk" when I pull out a drawe. Today I put a laptop on that setup on a treadmill at my apartment gym. Joyous discovery :) I guess I found a new office.

I played board games all night with friends! It's been so long since I've done a game night, and it was pretty great.

Today I built a bookcase and finally hung up my wall art. My room feels so much more cozy and I love it :)

Today I went swimming for the first time in a long time at the gym. I had such strong memories of my swim team days. It made me smile.

Today I came up with this great user testing idea using Pokemon cards. I felt pretty brilliant and I think its going to work.

I went to a free Master Pancake showing of Labryinth today at a beautiful theater in Austin. It was pretty great.

My talk at All Girl Hack Night went really well. And we had a really great conversation afterward :) I felt confident answering all of their questions too.

We had drawing club at work today. And it was pretty great! I did a decent job capturing others.

01/16/2015
---
I had a JS beakthrough today! I had started Sass Director over with a recursive object method, and holy crap it worked! That moment of elation when all of your hard work has paid off!

On my run today I found somebody's wallet in the middle of the sidewalk, found them on social media, and returned it to them :) The gratefulness they felt was infectious.

It is SO beautiful outside right now in Austin that I want to cry. Instead of staying inside, I'm laying outside in the common lawn area of my apartment complex, and I'm going hiking with Lauren soon.

Other than launching sassdirector.com, today I solved Michael's VM: Vagrant runner issues without having any errors to help me out AND another coworker told me that his New Years Resolution was to attend all of the weekly events for the FED Knowledge Share I started at IBM. Pretty awesome day.

Today was a reminder of why I love the open source community so much. Yesterday I publicized Sass Director, and somebody has already built a node module for it. Another person did their first PR for it :)

01/21/2015
---
It feels so good to make people who mentored me throughout college proud. Today I got a lot of Twitter praise for Sass Director from them :)

Today was ATXSass with Dave Rupert. The event went really, really well and we had a bunch of people there. It was awesome to see the event taking off.

Bryan and I drove to Tahoe today. The stars were inCREDIBLE. I've never seen so many in my life. The entire drive up I kept trying to peek up to see them more and when we arrived I was just blown away.

Today I went skiing for the first time. Yes, I was terrible at first, but then I really got the hang of it. I ended up seriously kicking ass (only on the green trails!) but still it felt like I was flying.

01/25/2015
---
Today I watched the lights change on the Bay Bridge. It was stunnning and super interesting to watch and I couldn't look away.

01/27/2015
---
I made cards for the people who contributed to my Open Source projects today -- watercolor calligraphy and handwritten thank yous.

Today I left work early to work outside from my roof deck of my apartment. :) It was absolutely perfect out.

Today I went to a coffee shop called Cherrywood for the first time with Mae and Dahn. There was live music and we sat outside.

One of my new friends came over tonight and really confided in me about her life and relationship. We sat on my porch and talked. I'm really glad that she felt so comfortable with me already to be so honest with me.

Today I presented a master class on Sass for Skillcrush. Someone tweeted at me afterward saying "@Una thank you so much for the Sass class! I can't wait to learn more and you're a wonderful inspiration!"
