One happy moment per day, so by the end of the year, I'll have 365 happy moments to look back on :)

Today I played with an Arduino and made an LED light blink when I held down a button. It made me really happy :) and I understand circuits and resistors a lot better now.

Today I caught up with Jeff Rohde (someone I end up seeing biannualy but its always such a joy :) ). This reminded me of my resolution to be better at keeping in touch, so I set up a monthly Skype session on my iCal with him and other friend groups.

Today I went out with my Russian girl friends in Baltimore. There weren’t many people out because of the Ravens game (Ravens > Steelers), but Sasha and I didn’t mind -- we danced like nobody was watching -- literally. And took over the entire dance floor. No fucks, just dancing :)

Today I flew back to Austin from Baltimore and I met two really rad girls on the flight. One had done work for GirlSpark teaching girls chemistry concepts, and the other was a UX designer reading "Don't Make Me Think" -- my favorite UX book.
