Okay so keeping with the positive theme, I probably lost about 6 lbs today because I've been sick and unable to eat or drink. So while I spent the day in bed with a stomach bug, I probably didn't need another full day of day drinking.

05/26/2016
---
I was well enough to make it to the beach today! #littlewins. I just lay in the shade and watched 3 more videos from Google I/O that I had saved earlier for offline.

05/27/2016
---
I still felt kind of sick today, and I got a massage to help with some aching from laying in bed all day. By night, I felt well enough to finally go out and dance, though!

05/28/2015
---
It's my last day in the Dominican Republic. I'm still feeling a little sick but the weather is so nice and I'm going to miss the little hummingbird that has a nest (with TWO eggs now!) near our beach spot.

05/29/2016
---
I finally came back home to Austin today. The flights were rough, as I realized I'd left my wallet, keys, and ID in the Punta Cana Airport, but Alex got me flowers and got me a spare key and made my bed for when I got back. It was super super nice of him!

05/30/2016
---
Alex hosted a Memorial day pool party at our apartment and had a big cook out. He made this absolutely *incredible* short rib (seriously, it was the best I've ever had, and I watched how it took him literally all day to make). We also made caramel creme-brule cheesecake strawberries together :)

05/31/2016
---
I worked at Cenote today, and learned that there's a discount for paying in cash instead of card. No tax!

06/01/2016
---
Went on an impromptu date today with Alex. We went to Isla and OMG the chef's seasonal ceviche is amazing. Amazing. I love their ceviche and their cocktails and I want to eat ceviche forever.

06/02/2016
---
I got a lot of work done today. It was just a production day, but I made a lot of progress on my talk and I almost finished it!

06/03/2016
---
Because it's so nice out, but also I have to finish this talk, I went to Mozarts with Alex after work. We then got dinner at Hula Hut when it started POURING this ridiculous torrential downpour. But we got home and instead of going out, stayed in to catch up on Game of Thrones :)

06/04/2016
---
Hack for Change was today! It's been a lot of fun and I'm trying to only do JavaScript/ avoid UI engineering to try something new. I've been successful so far.

06/05/2016
---
At the hackathon, Alex and I made a friend David who was on our team, who invited us to come with him to go floating down the San Marcos river. The weather was perfect! Insanely perfect!

06/06/2016
---
Today I ate way too much. I got Korean hot pot with a bunch of friends, some of whom I hadn't seen in much too long, and then we all went to Mooji for ice cream sandwiches. The seats were swings!

06/07/2016
---
I worked pretty late today with Alex for company. It was nice to be able to build and have someone just sit next to me in the meantime. I started building an app using getUserMedia and blend modes.

06/08/2016
---
Today was so, so productive at work, and I finally saw some real metrics behind what I've been doing to improve performance and accessibility. It was pretty rad.

06/09/2016
---
Alex and I made dinner today (avocado pesto zucchini pasta with shrimp). We used the basil plants we've been growing for the pesto :)

06/10/2016
---
I did a little bit of hand lettering today (which I hadn't done in a WHILE). That was super nice, especially taking a moment to sit down and actually paint again.

06/11/2016
---
I got brunch with a bunch of my friends today at East Side Cafe. I had never been there before but *loved* it (and the blue plate special was eggs Benedict on a lox+shrimp cake!). It was so good to see everyone before heading off to Amsterdam.

06/12/2016
---
I woke up early today, went to the gym, then hung around West Austin for a bit. I ended up in Paper Source admiring all of the cards and cute trinkets/gifts/papers for way too long.

06/13/2016
---
On the way to get mail, I ran into Alex in the elevator and he went with me. Turns out our cotton bureau shirts came in -- the ones with party parrot on them. We put them on when we got to my place and imitated the parrot. It's all captures on video. A beautiful video.

06/14/2016
---
I'm headed to Amsterdam today with Alex! I worked throughout the day and on the airplane for all of the domestic legs of the flight. Felt pretty productive and like I was contributing a lot throughout the day.

06/15/2016
---
Today Alex and I arrived in Amsterdam and it was also the day of the speaker dinner. Dinner was at this Belgian place that provided wine pairings with the tapas-style food. SO MUCH WINE was drank. They served 7 glasses with the meal, plus we got Belgian beer beforehand.

06/16/2016
---
Today was the first day of the CSS Day conference!

06/17/2016
---
After the conference (I did my Practical Blend Modes talk today for the first time), I went to a really rad speakeasy called Door 74 with Alex and 2 other people we met at the conference. It was *such* a great bar in Amsterdam, and the drinks were super unique and came in these beautiful containers (tiki glasses with red currant, skulls, one drink was out of a horn). We also went to a pretty nice bar after that one called Tales & Spirits across town.

06/18/2016
---
Alex and I went to the flower market today (our last day in Amsterdam). We woke up way too late (oops) and ended up having a lunch that consisted of free cheese samples from all of the cheese stores :P I'm amazed at the variety of flowers here!

06/19/2016
---
Today is Open House Porto -- an event where you can walk through private (non touristy) buildings with their architects and learn about their histories. I did this event and even met a friend with Alex. We did a ton of walking and ended our night with dinner at a piadina restaurant that had an olive tree table!

06/20/2016
---
I had my first pastel de Nata today at the Café Magestic! Then, Alex and I went to the top of the Clergios tower/explored the church. Afterward, we went to an awesome park in front of it where we sat on the grass and drank "shaken" coffee out of champagne flutes.

06/21/2016
---
I went to the beach today with Alex in Matoshinos. It was super nice to relax there for a bit, even though the water was freeeezing. Later in the night, we made dinner and stayed in drinking green wine from the market downstairs and watching Silicon Valley.

06/22/2016
---
Today Alex and I sort of stumbled upon Sé Porto (Cathedral) and ended up on the top of the Luis bridge. The views were honestly breathtaking (and so was climbing all of those stairs :P) Worth it!

06/23/2016
---
Today was Sao João! It's an insane holiday and definitely my new favorite. Alex and I got little plastic hammers to bang on everyone's heads and ate grilled sardines and watched really exceptional fireworks. The atmosphere was electric, and I even helped a group of people launch a lantern! We then danced outside at various dance parties and drank until 5:30 AM. Seriously. It was amazing.

06/24/2016
---
Tonight, Alex and I stumbled upon an *amazing* dining spot called Reitoria near the Galeria de Paris. We split a bottle of wine and had the most beautiful meat and cheese plate I've ever seen.

06/25/2016
---
I went to Aveiro today with Alex! It's such a cute little town. They call it the Venice of Portugal because of the canals, but it's much much smaller. We toured around in one of the gondola-like boats and then watched most of a soccer game in an outdoor viewing area with a bunch of other people while eating Port-flavored ice cream (with Port jam on top!),

06/26/2016
---
Alex and I rode a train into the Douro Valley region today to get to the vineyard we were staying at. WOW. It is BEAUTIFUL here. Honestly, I'm so so so stunned by the landscape, and the vineyard (Quinta De La Rosa), which had a pool and a few trails to walk, was perfect.

06/27/2016
---
Tonight Alex and I finally got into the restaurant called Puro (apparently its new in Porto and also weirdly hard to get into). Anyway -- it was *AMAZE*. The best meal I've had here, and I've had a lot of great meals. We had wild boar for two for dinner and I still don't understand how it was so tender and crunchy at the same time. The potatoes on the side were super homey and great, too :)

06/28/2016
---
There's a little tea shop on Rua das Flores, right by where we're staying in Porto, and we keep trying to go but never find it open. Today, it was finally open, and it was *so* yummy! There was an upstairs part which used to be a jewelry store, so Alex and I explored a bit up there and found an old sketchbook full of jewelry sketches.

06/29/2016
---
Today Alex and I woke up early(er than usual) to rent bike and bike to the beach. We ended up biking 1.5 hours away to this chapel on the beach. I collected stones, Alex took some stabilized videos, and we both got incredibly sunburnt.

06/30/2016
---
We walked over to the Cristal Palace today and hung out in the gardens for a while watching two Mama peacocks and about 9 baby chicklet peacocks. Afterward we went to the Bolhao market and got some souvenirs and fruit (I also got fuzzy almonds). It's a super cool place.

07/01/2016
---
It's our last day in Porto! Alex and I did a tour of the monestary up on the hill (amazing view!) and got sangria before going on a boat tour. It was a good last day before packing up for Lisbon in the morning.

07/02/2016
---
Lisbon! We had one day to basically see all of Lisbon and we did our best. Alex and I wandered around a lot, and climbed a lot of hills, and did a walking tour through one of the neighborhoods. Then, we got dinner at this really cute wine bar where the entire restaurant was singing along to one of the customers taking the mic.

07/03/2016
---
This morning we stopped by a pastry shop that was a 10-minute walk from our AirBnB. We got way too much food (we each got a toast and a pastry -- one cream, one chocolate). But no regrets, because we ate the pastries on the plane and finished off our chocolate with some Port wine we snuck onboard.

07/04/2016
---
Happy 4th of July! Early today Alex and I drove out to a house his friends rented out for the long weekend. I tried to slackline and we had a water balloon fight and hung out in the river and set off sparklers and fireworks. It was perfect.

07/05/2016
---
Ahh it feels like I'm finally back to reality (although the past 3 weeks have been reality too, it's just a different feeling). I'm Back to working and it feels good to be productive. I also found a funny note from Alex while I was unpacking -- "Your cheese credentials". Nobody else reading this will understand that but I will :P

07/06/2016
---
I worked in a Starbucks today and did some grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Seems like a pretty normal day -- it was, but it was really enjoyable. I got a bunch of fresh food and meats and vegetables to cook this week. I'm happy to be cooking again in my kitchen after several weeks of mostly eating out.

07/07/2016
---
I went grocery shopping today (finally!). It was way more fun than it should have been because I hadn't gone in so long. I even picked up my favorite rice-free sushi from Whole Foods, and cant wait to cook!

07/08/2016
---
I stayed in tonight (woo! Friday!) but got some work done instead (specifically, going through that ES6 crash-course/refresher and building a Reveal Caniuse extension-type-thing). I also bought and filled out a 2016-17 planner with some flight infos!

07/09/2016
---
Tonight I saw a Master Pancake version of Raiders of the Lost Arc with a few friends at the Alamo Drafthouse (this is a comedy group that uses a movie as its basis). It was really funny and I got a tequila-infused chocolate milkshake (it was great, I swear), and then we went out dancing on 6th street.

07/10/2016
---
Today I got brunch at Geraldine's with Alex and afterward went down the street to Bar 96 to watch the Euro cup final (Portugal v. France). Portugal won! Yay! I was rooting for them since we were just in Portugal and missing it a ton already.

07/11/2016
---
I planned to do a little Pokewalk outside of downtown to get some pokemon today. Alex ended up picking me up and we both went to Mueller park where we hung out for 2 hours to catch some, and I reached level 5! It was so nice of him to hang out with me that long while I played despite him having 0 interest in Pokemon.

07/12/2016
---
PokemonGO stops opened in Austin! Today was such a fun day! I ended up walking all the way home through north Austin, the University of Texas, Burnet Road, and ended up at the Capitol, playing Pokemon with a bunch of players (and my friend who came to meet me) where lures were set up all night!

07/13/2016
---
So now that there are Pokemon stops in downtown, its been super easy to power up! I took a walk during lunch to collect Pokemon. It felt great :)

07/14/2016
---
Tonight I went to Blues on the Green (finally!) with Alex and some of his friends. This event is HUGE -- its crazy how many people attend. We got gyros and listened to music and hung out in Zilker park.

07/15/2016
---
Today I took the train up to the Domain to hang out for Jefferson's going away happy hour at Dogwood. We got drinks, then had dinner at Gloria's, and another group went to go see the movie Finding Dory. It was a fun Friday.

07/16/2016
---
I went on an extended Pokemon hunt today with Troy! I walked to Auditorium Shores and we hung out there for a while before moving on. It was so hot I jumped in the fountain (yes, an outdoor fountain full of children), and regret nothing.

07/17/2016
---
I went on another winery tour today for my birthday with a group of friends! We did brunch first and then visited 3 wineries. One of the wineries had peach and also jalepeño wine. It was really.. interesting. And they had the people celebrating birthdays take a shot of all of the (6) wines we tasted there (which was surprisingly good).

07/18/2016
---
Today a bunch of us got together for Lauren's house closing happy-hour-type-thing. Afterward I got gellato with Brian and Troy and we went down to auditorium shores to hunt for some charmanders.

07/19/2016
---
What a glorious day! I found my keys! They are not lost! And I ate or Koriente for the first time. It's really yummy :) I got a meal there which I took to the Capital to "Poke Picnic" at.

07/20/2016
---
Since I'm flying out tomorrow to head to Baltimore, I celebrated my birthday today with Alex. He made me a really fantastic dinner -- scallop salad and veal with brussels sprouts. AND he made me a chocolate-espresso cheesecake as my bday cake. AND he sponsored an emoji on my behalf AND we went to this rad new speakeasy called the Floppy Disc Repair Company.

07/21/2016
---
I flew to Baltimore today and got to see my family and my pupper Lucy again. Shes always so excited when she sees me it makes me really happy.

07/22/2016
---
I'm 24 today! Ahh crazy. I got a lot of love from friends both in person and online. That meant a lot to me :)

07/23/2016
---
Today was full of so much love! The day started with my DC friends driving up to get brunch with me and my high school friends. Then, my family came over for a birthday dinner and afterward I went out with my Russian group of friends in Baltimore city. It was a lot of drinking and a lot of love. All in all, great birthday.

07/24/2016
---
I went wedding dress shopping with my best friend Liza today! It's so crazy that she will be a married lady soon and I'm going to be her maid of honor at her wedding. She looked really amazing in a few of the dresses and I really think she has already found a great one.

07/25/2016
---
I worked from home next to my pup Lucy today. If you sit in the right place, she will come snuggle next to you and pass out and snore just a tiny bit. It's so cute.

07/26/2016
---
It has been so long since I had good sushi, so my Mom and I got some sushi at a local place where the waiters literally know my family. It was yummy and made me super happy :)

07/27/2016
---
My Mom had a buy one/ get one free entree at Bonefish grill so we decided to go together. I love love love fish and they do some pretty great grilled fish dishes. I got salmon and blackberry sangria.

07/28/2016
---
I got crabs today with my Mom at an adorable crab shack in my hometown. The cream of crab soup had chunks of crab meat in it and was SO GOOD. And the crabs were great too :) I love Baltimore during crab season.

07/29/2016
---
Liza had people over for a dinner party tonight. I made brussels sprouts with melted Parmesan cheese, which went over very well :) It was also just a great time with a great crew. Perfect end of my Baltimore trip.

07/30/2016
---
Today I began my journey to Argentina! And I got upgrades on both of my flights today :) Even though they were both delayed, sitting in first class with unlimited wine is the best way to sit on a delayed plane.

07/31/2016
---
I finally arrived in Buenos Aires today! And my luggage arrived to :) Tonight I ended up meeting up with a friend of a friend at this big college party the Hillel at the University of Buenos Aires threw, with a ton of student art, poetry, a live band, and live mural painting. I had a lot of Fernet and talked to a bunch of people.

08/01/2016
---
Today a few of the speakers who are local and organizers got together for dinner. OH my gosh. We went to a place with large plates intended for sharing and sure got a filling serving. So much meat. It was *so* good too. We stayed till midnight chatting and a few of them walked me home.

08/02/2016
---
I co-worked from this really cool agency called Aerolab today. They had great wifi, a cute space, and everyone was *so* nice! I got a tortilla for lunch and played ping pong with a few of the people here :) We got a lot of progress done on the website rebuild as well.

08/03/2016
---
I got to the speaker hotel today (called ILUM Hotel) and OMG is it beautiful. There's a water feature and good breakfast and floor-to-ceiling windows and they changed the bed out twice (one for the morning look and one for the evening!). I even took a bath today with jets!

08/04/2016
---
Today I had dinner by myself in Palermo, but it was *so* nice. I tried to order a salad to be healthy and got a heaping plate of chicken and dressing. It's fine, it was amazing. I also got the kumquat cocktail they had on special (I don't think I've ever had kumquats before to be honest). As soon as dinner came, someone set up two PokemonGO lures I was sitting in between. It was magical.

08/05/2016
---
I took a day off and went on a day trip to Uruguay (to a little town called Colonia) today. It was so nice! And I met a really rad woman on my tour who was headed to the Rio Olympics afterward. We had a lunch of local cheese and wine in this little cellar restaurant (we had a little too much Malbec for sure).

08/06/2016
---
Today Harry and I walked around all over the Recoleta area. We went to this really good lunch place, then a famous, and beautiful cemetary, then saw this metal flower statue. Speaker dinner for CSS Conf AR was also tonight and it was at this asado place -- which meant meat, meat, and more meat. OMG it was so good! And there was this pumpkin stuff too that was on pointe!

08/07/2016
---
I gave the first talk at the very first CSS Conf in South America today! The conference was great and the talk went really well and I'm so happy they're building up the community down there. The organizers are amazing. Its been a great day!

08/08/2016
---
Today I arrived in NYC for the kickoff of Shark Week! I wasn't as tired as I thought I would be and it was super cool to see everyone again!

08/09/2016
---
After work today was the DigitalOcean Women in Tech drinks. It was a nice event and we had an outdoor area in this speakeasy (yeah, I know that sounds strange). After, I got back to the office and proceeded to watch the Olympics there with one of my coworkers in our CEOs office bc there is a nice couch in there and its a nice open space.

08/10/2016
---
Today we did a Pokemon walk as a DO activity, and afterward celebrated the website launch with a team dinner at this Japanese restaurant called 6 Bond Street. Oh my god, we ordered *SO* much sushi they brought out this giant table-sized cylindrical bowl, and it was *SO* good. We also had a bit of sake.

08/11/2016
---
We had a game night at DO as a closing party for Shark Week since some people were not attending the weekend. I played werewolf for the first time and Connect Four with Joel and danced a little too. We ended up playing a massive game of flip cup, and since I dont drink beer, convinced the bartender to just let me take 2 bottles of champagne to the table, and played with that instead.

08/12/2016
---
Today was the first day of Shark Weekend! We drove down and played werewolf on the bus (some *really* good rounds of it). The hotel is super super nice, with very comfortable beds. We also had a few cabanas reserved for us, so the drinking began as soon as we arrived to the hotel. Drinking, swimming, and eventually dancing after dinner by the hotel bar. It was a fun night.

08/13/2016
---
I tried surfing for the first time today. I also learned I suck at surfing today. I did manage to catch four waves with the help of an instructor, and got up on my knees on two of them, however! So I was proud of myself for the day.

08/14/2016
---
We got back from Shark Weekend today. I had a good time chatting with everyone in the morning and going to brunch, but I was just so worn out from the week. I very happily spent the evening watching the Olympics and doing some ES6 tutorial watching by myself in my room. Gymnastics was on!

08/15/2016
---
I finally got back to Austin today! It's SO nice to be back! And snuggling with Alex at night! I can' even describe how nice that was after 3 weeks of being apart.

08/16/2016
---
I went to trivia with some friends today at the Goodnight. I was pretty bad at it, but Chris is ridiculous at trivia. Our team won but couldn't get any prizes because we had too many people :P Was still fun nonetheless!

08/17/2016
---
I put my things up for sale today and they went so quick! I wasn't expecting that at all. So basically I've got a really good head start on getting rid of most of my things.

08/18/2016
---
Today I went on my last date in Austin with Alex! Ahhh! I asked him out in the morning thinking it would be nice to go to Peche one more time :) and he suggested we also stop by my favorite Mexican place in town -- La Condesa. Since the wait was long, we even got a chance to stop into a bar called Second on Congress for a quick drink. It was a really nice evening.

08/19/2016
---
We had a little Austin-family potluck dinner tonight :) It was super nice. We also played this game called Code Word and I watched the first episode of Stranger Things with 6 other people who had already seen it :P Show is crazy!

08/20/2016
---
Lauren came over today to help me pack. We got a lot accomplished together, then got lunch at Blue Dahlia and got caught in an insane rain storm on the walk back home. After we got dry and I let her borrow some clothes, we watched the 2nd episode of Stranger Things.

08/21/2016
---
I went to Bennu coffee today :) which is my favorite coffee shop in Austin to take a little break from packing and enjoy my time there. I'm glad I did.

08/22/2016
---
Today is my last full day in Austin! I went to Odd Duck with a few of my friends to celebrate. The food was good, but the company was even better. Lauren brought me a book (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn) as a parting gift because I was saying I might be moving to Brooklyn.

08/23/2016
---
After a long, hectic day of packing up my things, I ended up in Maine finally and Alex picked me up from the airport. The first thing I noticed was how dark it was here and how clear the stars were. Still haven't seen it in the daytime, though!

08/24/2016
---
Today I went on a boat ride with Alex's family and their family friend. It went all around the town they live, around some of the islands, and was SO pretty and nice. We also had snacks on the boat and Moscow Mules.

08/25/2016
---
This morning I went swimming with Alex, his sister, and his dog Lucky at their local swimming hole. It was so nice :) And we definitely swam her out.

08/26/2016
---
Today we made pizza and used the pizza oven Alex built with his dad to cook it. They also made ribs and later Alex and I made foccacia bread in it. It was pretty cool.

08/27/2016
---
Alex took me to one of his favorite places in Maine today, Monhegan Island. Its a beautiful island with a small village that is an artist community with some beautiful coastal hikes and views. We hiked all day and went to a super still lake with nobody around that we jumped in on the ride home. We came home to an amazing dinner of the ribs from the day before and zucchini fritters.

08/28/2016
---
I went on a long hike to Tumbledown Mountain (which was actually more like a junior mountain climb/ boulder scramble) with Alex today. It was so vertical it was crazy, but it was fun, the view was incredible, and there was a sweet little pond at the top of the mountain we relaxed and ate lunch nearby.

08/29/2016
---
Today I met up with my friend Ian in Portland, Maine and we went to this really cool speakeasy called Lincoln where all of the drinks were $5 and it was truly a hard-to-find place. We then got oysters for dinner.

08/30/2016
---
Before I left for the airport to fly to Zurich, I gave Alex's family some little gifts, one of which was for his dog Lucky -- a hedgehog squeeky toy I thought was adorable. She seemed to really love it too :)

08/31/2016
---
I arrived in Zurich today and settled into my hotel, just in time to do some work and have some meetings before the speaker's dinner. Dinner was nice (a lot of hummus and Mediterranean food) and it was a great reunion with a few people I know from the conference community.

09/01/2016
---
Today I spoke at FrontEnd Zurich! Its an awesome conference venue in an old paper mill. The talk went well and I got really positive feedback. The after party was really good too -- great snack food and seriously *huge* olives.

09/02/2016
---
Alex met me, Harry, and his girlfriend Jillian today at this 360 degree panoramic bar in Zurich called the Jules Vernes bar. It was an awesome view and a good crowd and an all-in-all fun evening. We stayed out drinking until the bars closed.

09/03/2016
---
Today Alex and I wandered around Zurich. Its a beautiful city! Like, REALLY beautiful. I can't get over it. We ended up at a large, wooden structure on the lake, built for an art festival called Manifesta, and swam in the lake (so refreshing!).

09/04/2016
---
We ventured to Interlaken today! It was a rainy day, but it was still so cool to see how blue the lake water was and to take the train through the start of some pretty cool mountains.

09/05/2016
---
Today the rain continued, but Alex and I still wanted to explore! So we went to the St. Beatus caves outside of Interlaken. The caves themselves were closed, but the walk up was stunning nonetheless, and we got to go into the museum for free. After the caves we went to a chocolate making demo and ate a lot of chocolate :P

09/06/2016
---
Alex and I went to Junfraujoch (aka the "Top of Europe") today! This is the highest railway station in Europe, built on a glacier, and it was really really cool! There was an amazing view from the top and we were able to do a hike in the snow. It had just snowed there a lot from the past 2 days of rain (snow up there) so everything was super smooth and pristine-looking. After, we hiked a little bit on honestly the most beautiful hike I've ever been on (and it was all downhill!).

09/07/2016
---
I went paragliding today! It was SO COOL! Both Alex and I did it: we ran off the side of a mountain and took off like birds, gliding over Interlaken and had an incredible view of the two lakes, the mountains, glacier, and the city. Afterward, we hiked up to Harder Kulm (the mountain on the other side of Interlaken)
 and had lunch up there before setting off for Zermatt.

09/08/2016
---
This morning (before finally getting back to work) Alex and I went up to Gornergrat and hiked down to the train stop 2 stops down. The hike was SO beautiful, with views of the Matterhorn the entire way and it even reflected in one of the lakes! It was a great day :)

09/09/2016

Alex and I woke up early today to do the 5-Seenweg (5 Lakes) hike. We took the tram up to Gonergrat and hiked down (it ended up being like 4 hours of walking because we got a little off the trail a few times and ended up walking through a village and seeing sheep and it was fine). So the hike was great :) and then I got a lot of refactoring work done, and then we went out to dinner at a Swiss place in town.

Today we celebrated Alex's birthday since its our last day together on this trip! We hung out in Zermatt a little and did some souvenir shopping, then headed to Zurich, where we went to a super nice dinner at a restaurant called Parkhuus, where the waitress informed us there was a huge festival/carnival in town. So  of course we went to that afterward :) It was so much fun going on the rides and seeing the random things they were selling there :P Great last night.

Today I traveled to Freiburg for SmashingConf! It was also the night of the speaker dinner, which was on a big hill on thee outset of the city, so you got a beautiful sunset view of the town and the big church in its center. Vitaly also prepared fireworks for us, and we stepped outside to see them in the middle of dinner. That was definitely a first as far as speaker dinner's go.

09/12/2016
---
I spoke at SmashingConf today! The talk went well and I also sang a little song to kickoff the conference. It was honestly a great series of talks today. After the conference, we went to an after party at the planetarium where they got us in one of those round-roofed rooms and show a constellation show. It was pretty cool. The night ended at this lovely cocktail bar called the Hemingway bar.

09/13/2016
---
I went to Smashing today and spent a bit of the conference working on a little open source project, building a caniuse component to get up-to-date data so you don't have to manually take screenshots before talks, and a little e-card for Alex's birthday. It was really fun to build again and be productive. The night ended in Hemingway bar again, debating the merits and usage of SMIL, which I learned wasn't getting deprecated just yet.

09/14/2016
---
Its Alex's actual birthday today, and I sent him a little Codepen thing I made for him. I love that idea --  doing little pens for each other each week :) I'm also flying back today and managed to release the caniuse component in between airplanes and get a lot done on the trip like start my new talk.

09/15/2016

Today was my first day home! Ahh so refreshing to just chill for a little bit. I cleaned my desk/closet at home, did laundry, worked next to Lucy, and helped Liza plan her bachelorette a little bit.

09/16/2016
---
I went on a run today for the first time in a long time, and even though it was a pretty short run, it felt really, really good. I also played around with my pup Lucy outside for a bit and she got covered in dried grass and it was super cute. I love my new FitBit a lot already!

09/17/2016
---
Today I got sushi with my mom and brother before heading to the airport to go to London, then Bucharest. I love getting sushi :) it was so yumm. And my mom knows the people at this sushi place/they know her order/preference. Anyway it was just so funny to go with her.

09/18/2016
---
Today I had a 9 hour layover at Heathrow. So I ended up going to the Windsor Castle area to get some fresh air and some lunch outside by the castle. It was a lovely day and I listened to like half of an audio book by the end of it (6 hours!).

09/19/2016
---
Tonight was the speaker dinner for SmartWeb in Bucharest. The dinner was at this really awesome, old restaurant which was *beautiful* on the inside (ceiling covered with paintings). There was also live music and much Romanian food.

09/20/2016
---
SmartWeb was today! And I was so committed to my weight loss goal that I left the conference to go work out and came back :P

09/21/2016
---
Today I walked around Old Town with Anna and Ruth from the conference yesterday. We wandered around shops and went to this beautiful, huge bookstore I stumbled upon yesterday for coffee. It was super nice to wander.

09/22/2016
---
I did a walking tour of Bucharest today in the old town. It was a great tour and I learned a ton about the history of the city and how much it was changed under communism.

09/23/2016
---
Today I toured the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest (the second biggest building in the world!). And this building is ridiculous -- its bigger underground than above ground and is allegedly filled with escape tunnels. It was super ridiculous how grand it was, and I ended up meeting a few people on the tour that I got lunch with afterward.

09/24/2016
---
Today I am flying back to Baltimore (it's a long day full of many flights). I watched Boyhood on the flight today, which is a really good movie! I loved it :)

09/25/2016
---
I hung out at home with my Mom and dog today. It was nice to chill. I'm also starting up with healthy habits again and that feels pretty good. Even got my Mom to go to the gym with me.

09/26/2016
---
Woke up to my dog, Lucy laying at my feet this morning :) That was a nice little happy moment.

09/27/2016
---
Today was launch day for Hacktoberfest! We immediately got a lot of positive reactions to it and I'm so happy to get to be a part of the behind-the-scenes this year!

10/28/2916

Today my dad came home from his work trip to China (I'm at my family's home right now!), and he brought a variety of goodies back with him: interesting candy from China and Japan, little trinkets, and even picked out a little handbag for me that caught his eye in Japan :) It was really nice of him!

10/29/2016
---
I got my first piece of indie makeup today -- the Nubian pallet by Juvia's Place! And I really, really love it! It's super pigmented and has a lot of beautiful bronze shades which look really good with my warm skintone :D

10/30/2016
---
Today I talked to Katie on our People Team if I could take advantage of the relocation perks DigitalOcean offers. She said I could, so I have 2 months of corporate housing in New York available to me! Squee!

10/01/2016
---
Today I went over Liza's and hung out for a few hours watching football, eating, and drinking hot cider spiked with spiced rum. It was a rainy day and a bunch of their/our friends came over. By the end of the night it was 9 of us laughing and talking in a circle around the TV.

10/02/2016
---
Shanah Tova! Today I spent Rosh Hashanah with Liza's family. We had a bunch of different items which related to the holiday and a really good dinner overall. It was nice to get a chance to dress up (used that new makeup pallet) and to see them all, too.

10/03/2016
---
There's this really cute virtual game called paperplanes.world that Alex introduced me to today. You can send planes and catch other planes and stamp them with your location and send them out again. It really put a smile on my face :)

10/04/2016
---
Today I had a personal training session with Louis. It was a lot of fun! We went outside for the session I got to bang at a huge tire and we did a glider + kettle bell workout. It was a lot of fun.

10/05/2016
---
Hacktoberfest has been really awesome for CSSgram. Definitely a lot of new PR activity and two new filters were released today! Yay!

10/06/2016
---
I'm really enjoying the project I'm working on right now at work :) doing some fun data manipulation and visualization for Hacktoberfest.

10/07/2016
---
I went to the gym for a solid 1.5 hours today and did mostly cardio. Felt really good afterward and went to stretch, surprising myself by how flexible I still was.

10/08/2016
---
I went to the gym today and afterward did a bit of stretching. I was so surprised to see that I was still wayyy more flexible than I expected to be at this point.

10/09/2016
---
Today I met up with Jeff Rohde in DC to get brunch and explore Skyline Drive! We did a bit of hiking and saw the sunset over the Shenendoah valley. It was magical :) And so nice to catch up.

10/10/2016
---
I spent the entire day emersed in JS data visualization work. I'm super into building this Hacktoberfest stats page :) really enjoying it.

10/11/2016
---
I had personal training with Louis today. We flipped a tire! (together) and did some other drills outside which were very fun.

10/12/2016
---
Today I released youmightnotneedjs.com! It got a lot of awesome feedback immediately and started some interesting conversations. Glad to have gotten it out and for the response its getting!

10/13/2016
---
Today was Yom Kippur, so I was fasting all day and grumpy :P Break fast was nice though, all of my cousins came to my parents place for that and we ate awesome food my mom made.

10/14/2016
---
We finally had the chocolates from Switzerland that I brought back and OH MY GOD THEY ARE SO GOOD. I wasn't even expecting them to be that good.

10/15/2016
---
Today was my dads birthday party! My family rented out a restaurant with Uzbek food, and got everyone together. It was so yummy. But I got way too full :P and had cake too.

10/16/2016
---
I flew to San Francisco to see Alex today. Which was exciting in itself. We got brunch at Zazie's and then went on a walk up Carona Heights, where we saw a rainbow over the city. It was so rad! :P Also just nice to be together again.

10/17/2016
---
Alex and I got the BEST SUSHI EVER today at a restaurant called Blowfish. Not only was the sushi excellent, but it was also pretty unique and the presentation was beautiful. We had a fish tartare pyramid and some really nice sashimi. A healthy and beautiful dinner that impressed us a lot :P

10/18/2016
---
Today I worked from a super cool coffee coworking space in the Mission called Covo. The place was huge adn beautifully decorated with a chandellier and a mix of modern contruction-y feel. They gave me a free day of coworking which included a free coffee from the coffee shop they have in-house (which was really good!). Great place to work and I got a lot done.

10/19/2016
---
Today I met up with a coworker of mine from IBM who I was great friends with and worked closely with (Ryan Brownhill). He's doing great and that was awesome to see :) Lunch at Tacolicious with him and Alex was also delicious, as was the place we stumbled on later that day for dinner, called Lohilohi. While the portions we got were way too big, but we ended up making friends at the bar where we ate and shared.

10/20/2016
---
Alex made a reservation for cocktails at a speakeasy called Wilson & Wilson. The place was super super cool and the drinks were *SO* yummy. I loved the atmosphere -- we went through like 3 bars to get there, and we had some really good, real conversation. Before the speakeasy, Alex and I went to the California Institute of Science inside of Golden Gate Park for their Thursday night event. Each area had a bar with a difference specialty drink and it was super cool to go through the museum and drink in different areas. Petting starfish was particularly cool.

10/21/2016
---
Happy Friday! Today Alex and I went to Teche(sp?) for happy hour drinks and guac (hello $18 pitcher of Sangria!). The place has a beautiful view of the city. We then stumbled into getting the last spot for dinner at a restaurant right next door to it, which played vintage movies in its outdoor space. It was such a cool restaurant and the food was *incredible*. I think my favorite from the trip. I got a steak bavette with creamy potatoes gratin that I died for. We later went to Smugglers Cove and Noir Lounge with his friend for drinks.

10/22/2016
---
Today I drove out of San Francisco an hour to go to a pumpkin patch with a hay maze with Alex and a few of his college friends. We stopped by a place called Breakers in Pacifica for breakfast and then after the pumpkin patch went to this Brew Festival at Half Moon Bay. It was so much fun! And I actually enjoyed a lot of the beers there! Live music and a brewfest was a great way to end the trip before heading to the airport to fly out.

10/23/2016

I've literally been on an airplane all day and I technically have lost this day in my life because I left saturday night and arrive Monday morning in Australia :P So not much to say in terms of happy moments, but I did watch the TV show Veep on the plane and really liked it so far :)

10/24/2016
---
I made it to Perth! The AirBnb Joel and I are sharing is INCREDIBLE! Like such a beautiful big room. We were picked up from the airport by Mixin organizers who also brought us little goodie bags. They were SO awesomely personalized! Like even including custom illustrations, a wifi dongle, and a letter for every day of the week. Seriously impressed with everything today!

10/25/2016
---
We went to Rottnest Island today with the Mixin crew! I got a really awesome quokka selfie almost immediately after we got there :D. The island is so beautiful and we spent a lot of time walking around and trying to get the best quokka selfies. There were also seals we walked up to (about 20 ft. away) and hung out/watched them. Such a fun day! Such a beautiful place!

10/26/2016
---
Today I went to the beach with Espen. It was crazy to see the waves crash so hard (and to see how big they are here in Australia!). After  the beach, we went to an event called Collide which brought together a few of the Perth design/dev communities for lightning talks. They were great! And the atmosphere was super friendly and inspiring :) I really love Perth dev communities.

10/27/2016
---
Today was the speaker dinner for Mixin Conf. It was at a restaurant overlooking the beach and we saw the sunset over the ocean. They gave us conference tshirts during dinner and I got a MailChimp hat! One of those knit ones with the monkey on it :) AHH! I've wanted one for so long. There was also an organizer-selfie competition going on, so that was a fun addition to the day.

10/28/2016
---
Today was Mixin Conf!! My talk went super super well (which made me very happy because it was new and I wasn't sure how it would go over). The conference itself was incredible and so full of love, and the after party was ridiculous :P It turned into a great dance party complete with glowsticks and loud singing after photobooth photoshoots.

10/29/2016
---
Today was sort-of bittersweet. I spent the day at a wildlife center in Perth and saw a wombat, tazmanian devil, and took selfies with a kangaroo. Then, we met up with the conference organizers and hung out for a while before saying goodbye. This conference had a particularly difficult goodbye because all of the organizers were seriously awesome and we all became pretty good friends by the end of the week :P Such an awesome week and I'm sad its over.

10/30/2016
---
Today I basically flew all day and did some time-traveling backward :P I did work on (and mostly finished) a CLI game in the browser though! That was so much fun to work on and build while traveling. It felt good to get something done. And I love doing so while traveling.

10/31/2016
---
Happy Halloween! I didn't really have a Halloween this year, but thats okay :P It was worth it to go to Mixin. I spent today getting my life back together basically. That means I'm back to healthy eating and recording and drinking way too much water. Its good.

11/01/2016
---
I'm getting really excited to move to NYC. I keep thinking about where I am in life and how I have no idea whats going to happen next and it feels good. Scary but good :)

11/02/2016
---
Rogie made me the COOLEST/CUTEST unicorn avatar! I love it so much! Going to use it for everything now :) Ahh yay!

11/03/2016
---
Today in the mail I got an Amazon IOT button shipped to me. I was confused at first, but then realized what it was and it really made me smile. Alex programmed it for me to send me puppy pictures or individual happy moments (how meta) when clicked :) He even packaged it up to say "Hello Una" and instructions on getting started. It was very cute.

11/04/2016

Flying into Berlin today! I spent the day in DC and got lunch with Vicki at WAPO on their rooftop lounge. The place is really awesome. It has a great view over the city and of the Washington Monument, and we even saw Air Force One fly in! Catching up with Vicki was really really nice :)

11/05/2016
---
Tonight I went pretty hard in Berlin (despite flying in today). I got dinner with a bunch of people at the Bird which was amazeee burgers, and then we started finding spots to drink. From the hotel bar to this small speakeasy/club-thing with a weird dragon/elf bust hanging off the wall and 80's music, I stayed out till 6 AM with a few people from Beyond Tellerrand. It was definitely a ton of fun, and a lot of different drinks were drank. And sleep needed to be had :P

11/06/2016
---
Today was so much fun. Despite waking up hungover, the breakfast at this hotel gave me life (it's amazing and there are mimosas!). I went to the spy museum with Gillian here in Berlin and it was really cool! I failed hard at the laser maze but learned a ton about espionage and was really impressed by some tiny cameras. On the way we stopped by this Mars ad for a Nat Geo program and did this upside-down spinny thing, too.

11/07/2016
---
Today was the speaker dinner for Beyond Tellerand. Afterward, I went to a bar with a few people and it ended up being one of the most fun nights I had on this trip. The bar was called Sharlie Cheen, and we ended up making friends, starting a dance party, and got a ton of free shots from the bartender, Paul. He even let us help him make drinks behind the bar (we were like the only ones there and its a Monday :P). Super fun night.

11/08/2016
---
Day 1 of Beyond Tellerand had some *incredible* talks. They were really impactful and well-delivered. I felt particularly inspired to not take "no" for an answer when I really wanted to make a change, and to charge ahead with ideas. So :) Al-in-all -- I've got some big shoes to fill for tomorrow.

11/09/2016
---
It was a really rough day for me/my country because of the election results, but I gave a good conference talk and finalized the book I'm going to be writing with Smashing. :)

11/10/2016
---
Today I flew home from Berlin and did a *lot* of book writing on the flight home. I wrote about 4,000 words -- which will be a solid chunk into what is ultimately going to be 50-60k words. I'm feeling pretty positive about the book and being able to get the writing I want done today, and the flight wasn't that bad.

11/11/2016
---
My parents went to get sushi today and brought me back some really yummy rolls. Also a bubble tea -- I normally hate bubble tea (well, I hadn't really given it a chance before), but liked this one a lot :) Maybe I'll change my tune if I think of it was a desert.

11/12/2016
---
I've been playing with a 3D software lately called Blender. It's been really tough to get into the software, but I'm really enjoying the outcomes of the 3D modeling. It's a lot of fun and instant gratification :P

11/13/2016
---
Today I went shopping with my Mama :) and bought a beautiful navy dress to wear for various holiday events. Yay! It was nice to get out and spend some time with her.

11/14/2016
---
I was working from home today and Lucy was sitting next to me and cuddled by me the whole day and slowly would peek up and put her head on my laptop. It was the cutest thing :)

11/15/2016
---
Today I went to the gym for the first time in a while. Felt so good. I had such a good workout because I was full of energy and really needed to get it out!

11/16/2016
---
I just hung out with Lucy at home today. She's such a cutie I can't get over it. Lucy loved laying in the sun, so I took out my phone to snap way too many photos of her lying on her back with her legs sprawled open laying in the sunshine.

11/17/2016
---
I ordered a solar system skirt and unicorn tshirt from ModCloth last week and completely forgot about it until they came in today! It was a great "surprise" :) Also, I painted my nails with this new gold sparkly polish I ordered, and oh my gosh its so fabulous. Super happy with it.

11/18/2016
---
Today in the mail I got my Hacktoberfest tshirt and stickers! It was such a nice surprise :D And I'm so obsessed with this gold nail polish, especially love seeing it in different lights!

11/19/2016
---
Friendsgiving was tonight, hosted by Liza and Matt. I made a fruit salad served inside of watermelons and mulled wine. Seeing everyone was great! I ate way too much food! (But it is cheat day on this diet I'm on now :P) It was just like no time had passed at all.

11/20/2016

Driving today was so nice. It was super windy outside but beautiful and all the leaves were red and orange and yellow and blowing around. I blasted some music in the car and enjoyed the sunshine and Autumn.
