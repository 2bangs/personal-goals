Hello 2017! Today I had brunch with my cousins, played a new board game with them all (makes me think I need to buy more board games), and cleaned all of my makeup brushes. I'm doing this year in review and reseting my goals for the year :) Feeling pretty good about a fresh start and getting my things together after a less-productive end of the year.

I had the day off of work today! My Mom and Dad put in some videos of our family from when I was a baby (literally I was 1 year old and a few months in all of the videos). They were *so cute* to watch :)

Back to the gym today to train with Louis. OMG he kicked my ass so much today. I'm kind of scared for tomorrow because honestly I could barely stand by the end of that lower-body workout. But it felt super super good to be back in the gym :)

I was pretty productive today! I had this idea for an app-thing I wanted to build to generate random hackathon ideas and ended up using Vue.js for the first time and stringing together a few modules pretty fast to get something running. It felt pretty good to go from idea to creation so fast. And its been a while since I built something, too.

It snowed today right as I was heading out to go to the gym. And when I finished my workout, the car was covered in it and the air was super fresh and I felt really good. It was so pretty outside :)

I went to a "wedding" dinner party today for Anna & Igor (who legally got married today but are having their actual wedding and reception later in the year). It was so cute :) and great to see this group of people I don't get to hang out with very often. Much food, a few games, and a bit of catching up. Was super nice.

Today was "move-in" day for my New York apartment in Brooklyn! It started snowing *hard* on the drive up (ended up being 7 inches!) but we prevailed, unloaded the car, and built a bunch of IKEA furniture. It was super productive. The highlight of the day was probably the dinner we had at Cafe Luluc. OMG it was so good. I got seafood soup and it ended up being a ton of mussels, shrimp, and lobster, and then got duck which was also *on pointe* and they even brought us complimentary creme brule! WOWOW. It was impressive. The service was also unbelievable (also helped that not many people were there due to the huge snow storm, but still), all in all, fantastic day.

I got breakfast in this cute place called Smile Cafe with my parents this morning before going back to my apartment to build the last shelving unit. It was all pretty efficient :) I'm happy to have gotten it all done.

Last workout with Louis! It was a fun one. We focused on deadlifting. SO many deadlifts! :P But I ended up lifting 145 lbs for 6 reps at one point, which isn't too bad. I'm going to miss Louis so much when I'm off to NY again.

Tonight was my grandpa's 80th birthday! We went to this Uzbek restaurant my family frequents, and the food was yummy and I got to see a lot of my family there too.

Tonight was Manhattan JS! My first one! It was such a great event, and I left it very inspired to build things. One of the talks was about data visualization and describing the entire process. Was super inspiring. And Rachel did an electronics talk, and now I'm all :) ahh need to build something.

Today Patricia and I had to take out the recycling, and we had a *lot* of big boxes from the furniture we had gotten, so we ended up throwing them down the stairs. It was actually a *lot* of fun to watch them go flying :P It was my first night in the new apartment too!

Today was Earl's going-away drinks. Afterward, I met up with Tim to get some dinner. During the wait, we met this Australian couple(?) who chatted with us a while and started up this questions game (our answers were supposed to reveal something about ourselves). :P That was fun, and food was great (cute little place in the East Village), and then we got absinthe and melted into the seats of this bar as we talked about life. Afterward, we went to my place where I gave Tim a Stromae-education. Not a bad night.

01/14/2016

I got brunch with my coworker this morning at Pietro Nolita--this entirely pink little restaurant near where the corporate apartment is. It was so cute! And very instagrammable :P Then I went on a little adventure with Patricia in search of kitchen ware at restaurant supply stores.

I joined CitiBike Share this morning :) and rode around a bit and then saw Arrival with Tim at the Alamo Drafthouse! Ahh it made me so happy to be biking again and also that the Alamo Drafthouse is so close to me :D It's about equidistant from me here than the one in Austin was.

I went on a date today at a shuffleboard place called the Royal Palms-- like real full-size shuffleboard. It was a lot of fun :) I wasn't great at it, but it's fine. We also played connect four and then headed to a bar on my street. Love this neighborhood.

We recorded Toolsday with Glenn Maddern today. It was so good to hear his perspective on things and the after-recording discussion about CSS was really good. Also just nice to catch up :) Reminds me why I love Toolsday so much.

Today was BrooklynJS! Which was really good. I got to meet Sarah from makeupconf who did a great talk about diagrams in documentation and learning styles. Hanging out afterward was nice too  :)

Went on a second date today with Stepan. We got drinks at Lumos, this small SoHo bar with *great* cocktails, and then went to see a Broadway show, Waitress. Then we went to the Blind Barber (finally made it here) and I ended up getting home at 3:30AM. One of those nights.

01/21/2017

Today I went over to John Resig's house with a small group to play board games. It was a lot of fun :) I forgot how much I love to play board games and he made some really good food for us. I left and bought one called Sushi Go on my way home.

01/22/2017

There was a Software for Artists Day (like a small conference) at Pioneer Works today. A lot of really cool projects were exhibited! Definitely left feeling inspired and wanting to do more.

Today I did some calligraphy-ing for the crafts and code logo. I'm excited about my future Twitch stream :)

I got these awesome unicorn makeup brushes in the mail today. Idk if I'll actually use them, but they just make me really happy.

I finally finished setting up service workers for my blog to have offline save capabilities. The post was published today and got a lot of really positive feedback. I'm so glad I finally did this!

DigitalOcean had a company event where they rented out a theatre for us to all watch Hidden Figures at. It was a great event :) So much food though!

After work today we had a happy hour for one of the people temporarily leaving the NYC office. Afterward, I went to see a midnight showing of the Big Lebowski with Pat and Tim. Definitely a fun but unexpected end to the night.

This morning I got breakfast tacos at Tacombi with two of my coworkers who are staying in the corporate housing with me. They're so yumm there and my coworkers are awesome :)

Today I stayed in bed because I'm sick most of the day, but I did watch the Little Prince on Netflix, which is really cute, and beautifully illustrated movie.

01/30/2017

I got back into writing my book today which I really need to do. It was good to catch up a bit and infuse some of the work I've been doing on side projects into the writing.

01/31/2017

Today I met with Pat to learn about the Photoshop brushes she uses. I got sent a whole pack and have been having a lot of fun experimenting. Also, Kasia had this really rad red/blue pencil that I tried out and

I'm finally feeling pretty good. Sudafed is amazing :) And I went to the gym today to celebrate this fact basically :P and ran/walked a pretty solid workout.

I went to pick up my bag from the corporate apartment and stopped by a book store called McNally Jackson on the way home. There happened to be an event going on and I couldn't help myself from dropping in. I bought a travel book that really spoke to me in the way it was written called "And The Monkey Learned Nothing" and I'm having a hard time putting it down.

Today I was on a panel at STEM night at the New York Hall of Science. It was an event themed around design and engineering for high school and college students, and it was really nice to chat with all of the students and their parents. Afterward I met up with a few people (including Ryan Brownhill who is in town!) for food and drinks, ending the night at Katz's deli again with Tim.

I played Fire Watch with Sam and Tim from start to finish today. The game is so beautiful! And a really enjoyable narrative. Afterward, we got Mexican food, margaritas, and ended up at a karaoke bar singing Lion King songs and Sheryl Crow.

02/05/2017

I got brunch at Dudley's with Tim today after watching the Lion King. Completely forgot about how good that movie is! It was a nice morning :)

I went on a run today and it felt *so* good! It was a beautiful view along the west side of Manhattan and I was listening to an amazing audiobook (Love Star) and it was just so good. Afterward, I went and chilled at 61 Local with Tim where there was a really awesome live band (Jess Best), and the staff ended up singing and it was kind-of magical.

02/07/2017

I freaking love my purple/pink hair :) I was getting ready for tomorrow's ManhattanJS today and doing errands and I caught myself checking it out in the mirror and felt great. Thank you Amanda!

Tonight was the dressed-up ManhattanJS! It was so much fun and everyone looked so fly. Afterward, a group of us went to karaoke in Korea town and got a bunch of sake and sang a lot and it was a ton of fun. Will do again.

02/09/2017

I met up with Sam Phippen at the Dead Rabbit--a really awesome cocktail bar that also has food. The menu was a comic book! And they switch it up regularly as a series! :P I even have a book from this bar with cocktail recipes, so its pretty famous. It was really nice to decompress with him and drink really awesome cocktails. I hope to go back soon.

After work we had the third-biweekly wine tasting. This week's theme was sparkling wine and we tasted 6 and had to pick out the real champagne from the bunch/guess which was which. I got them all wrong :P. I wanted to stay in tonight after going out the past two nights so I stayed in and did calligraphy invites for Liza's wedding. Tim came over later to read a book I recommended to him and to chill, and it was just a nice night in.

02/11/2017

I got dinner at this wine bar (Bar Veloce) with Tim--which was super good because when does wine + prosciutto + cheese ever turn out bad? :P Then we went to a comedy show where they read out breakups via text message, and got absinthe after. I ended up stopping by a liquor store and buying chartreuse and absinthe so I have that now :P Doc Henderson's--I'm excited to try it out.

02/12/2017

This morning I got breakfast with Tim at Westville which was super good because they had this great veggie market plate, which was a nice healthy wakeup before going to a chocolate-baking competition at the Royal Palms where my roommate, Patricia was competing. That was super fun because a lot of people showed up and we tasted *so* much chocolate. I loved the chocolate babka and chocolate sausage.

I had a really good run today on the west side of Manhattan. It was absolutely freezing out, but I was listening to Wild by Cheryl Strayed and just felt like I could keep going and going. It was such a good feeling despite the weather. Afterward I ordered sashimi and it was great. I'm feeling pretty confident about the running that I'm getting back into.

02/14/2017

Today was Valentines day and I spent it sending really weird valentines to my friends and Tim. I also had a trainer appointment with my new personal trainer and it felt *great*. He seems awesome and I'm really looking forward to getting back into gyming much more often.

02/15/2017

I saw Tim today. We went to this *amazing* restaurant called Ouiji after Tom Dale's glowing review on Twitter. The restaurant was reviewed by a food writer for the New York Times, and oh my god was it good. We had baby octopus in this beautiful swirled sauce and crispy chicken and a make-your-own mini crepes with seven flavors thing. But my favorite dish was definitely the honey chips with ice cream for desert. Oh my god were they good.

Today was paint night at DigitalOcean :) We got Mexican food and painted angelfish with an instructor. I had a lot of fun doing that. Afterward, I went to 61 Local and met up with a bunch of people for BrooklynJS (a non-ticketed no-talks just-hangs event). It was a good time and I heard a lot of travel stories.

02/17/2017
---
At work I got a DigitalOcean hat and scarf (and socks!). I also met up with Tim afterward to go see the Oscar nominated shorts (I meant to get us tickets to the animated shorts but messed up and got the live-action, which were also great).

02/18/2017

Today I woke up super early to fly to Colorado for an annual friend ski trip! I had a nice long drive with Troy to the condo we got on AirBnb and it was so nice to see everyone! We got dinner out and had a few drinks and hung out by the fire :) I fell asleep on the couch because I liked falling asleep by the fire and I stayed up a bit later with Alex and Troy.

Today I went skiing at Keystone. It was rough at first but I got the hang of it after a lot of initial falls. It was amazing to be on the mountain, and it ended up snowing a bit later in the day. Was a pretty magical sight to see so much snow at a ski resort :)

02/20/2017
---
My favorite part of today was snow tubing at Keystone. All 6 of us went snow tubing and it was just a lot of fun. The people there would spin you and you could go in groups up to four people. We did a few runs and it just felt really good to be out there again because I couldn't ski or do much other activity due to my leg.
