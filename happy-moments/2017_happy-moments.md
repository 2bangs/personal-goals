Hello 2017! Today I had brunch with my cousins, played a new board game with them all (makes me think I need to buy more board games), and cleaned all of my makeup brushes. I'm doing this year in review and reseting my goals for the year :) Feeling pretty good about a fresh start and getting my things together after a less-productive end of the year.

I had the day off of work today! My Mom and Dad put in some videos of our family from when I was a baby (literally I was 1 year old and a few months in all of the videos). They were *so cute* to watch :)

Back to the gym today to train with Louis. OMG he kicked my ass so much today. I'm kind of scared for tomorrow because honestly I could barely stand by the end of that lower-body workout. But it felt super super good to be back in the gym :)

I was pretty productive today! I had this idea for an app-thing I wanted to build to generate random hackathon ideas and ended up using Vue.js for the first time and stringing together a few modules pretty fast to get something running. It felt pretty good to go from idea to creation so fast. And its been a while since I built something, too.

It snowed today right as I was heading out to go to the gym. And when I finished my workout, the car was covered in it and the air was super fresh and I felt really good. It was so pretty outside :)

I went to a "wedding" dinner party today for Anna & Igor (who legally got married today but are having their actual wedding and reception later in the year). It was so cute :) and great to see this group of people I don't get to hang out with very often. Much food, a few games, and a bit of catching up. Was super nice.

Today was "move-in" day for my New York apartment in Brooklyn! It started snowing *hard* on the drive up (ended up being 7 inches!) but we prevailed, unloaded the car, and built a bunch of IKEA furniture. It was super productive. The highlight of the day was probably the dinner we had at Cafe Luluc. OMG it was so good. I got seafood soup and it ended up being a ton of mussels, shrimp, and lobster, and then got duck which was also *on pointe* and they even brought us complimentary creme brule! WOWOW. It was impressive. The service was also unbelievable (also helped that not many people were there due to the huge snow storm, but still), all in all, fantastic day.
