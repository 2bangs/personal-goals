Hello 2017! Today I had brunch with my cousins, played a new board game with them all (makes me think I need to buy more board games), and cleaned all of my makeup brushes. I'm doing this year in review and reseting my goals for the year :) Feeling pretty good about a fresh start and getting my things together after a less-productive end of the year.

01/02/2017
---
I had the day off of work today! My Mom and Dad put in some videos of our family from when I was a baby (literally I was 1 year old and a few months in all of the videos). They were *so cute* to watch :)

01/03/2017

Back to the gym today to train with Louis. OMG he kicked my ass so much today. I'm kind of scared for tomorrow because honestly I could barely stand by the end of that lower-body workout. But it felt super super good to be back in the gym :)

01/04/2017
---
I was pretty productive today! I had this idea for an app-thing I wanted to build to generate random hackathon ideas and ended up using Vue.js for the first time and stringing together a few modules pretty fast to get something running. It felt pretty good to go from idea to creation so fast. And its been a while since I built something, too.

01/05/2017
---
It snowed today right as I was heading out to go to the gym. And when I finished my workout, the car was covered in it and the air was super fresh and I felt really good. It was so pretty outside :)

01/06/2017
---
I went to a "wedding" dinner party today for Anna & Igor (who legally got married today but are having their actual wedding and reception later in the year). It was so cute :) and great to see this group of people I don't get to hang out with very often. Much food, a few games, and a bit of catching up. Was super nice.

01/07/2017
---
Today was "move-in" day for my New York apartment in Brooklyn! It started snowing *hard* on the drive up (ended up being 7 inches!) but we prevailed, unloaded the car, and built a bunch of IKEA furniture. It was super productive. The highlight of the day was probably the dinner we had at Cafe Luluc. OMG it was so good. I got seafood soup and it ended up being a ton of mussels, shrimp, and lobster, and then got duck which was also *on pointe* and they even brought us complimentary creme brule! WOWOW. It was impressive. The service was also unbelievable (also helped that not many people were there due to the huge snow storm, but still), all in all, fantastic day.

01/08/2017
---
I got breakfast in this cute place called Smile Cafe with my parents this morning before going back to my apartment to build the last shelving unit. It was all pretty efficient :) I'm happy to have gotten it all done.

01/09/2017
---
Last workout with Louis! It was a fun one. We focused on deadlifting. SO many deadlifts! :P But I ended up lifting 145 lbs for 6 reps at one point, which isn't too bad. I'm going to miss Louis so much when I'm off to NY again.

01/10/2017
---
Tonight was my grandpa's 80th birthday! We went to this Uzbek restaurant my family frequents, and the food was yummy and I got to see a lot of my family there too.

01/11/2017
---
Tonight was Manhattan JS! My first one! It was such a great event, and I left it very inspired to build things. One of the talks was about data visualization and describing the entire process. Was super inspiring. And Rachel did an electronics talk, and now I'm all :) ahh need to build something.

01/12/2017
---
Today Patricia and I had to take out the recycling, and we had a *lot* of big boxes from the furniture we had gotten, so we ended up throwing them down the stairs. It was actually a *lot* of fun to watch them go flying :P It was my first night in the new apartment too!

01/13/2017
---
Today was Earl's going-away drinks. Afterward, I met up with Tim to get some dinner. During the wait, we met this Australian couple(?) who chatted with us a while and started up this questions game (our answers were supposed to reveal something about ourselves). :P That was fun, and food was great (cute little place in the East Village), and then we got absinthe and melted into the seats of this bar as we talked about life. Afterward, we went to my place where I gave Tim a Stromae-education. Not a bad night.

01/14/2017
---
I got brunch with my coworker this morning at Pietro Nolita--this entirely pink little restaurant near where the corporate apartment is. It was so cute! And very instagrammable :P Then I went on a little adventure with Patricia in search of kitchen ware at restaurant supply stores.

01/15/2017
---
I joined CitiBike Share this morning :) and rode around a bit and then saw Arrival with Tim at the Alamo Drafthouse! Ahh it made me so happy to be biking again and also that the Alamo Drafthouse is so close to me :D It's about equidistant from me here than the one in Austin was.

01/16/2017
---
I went on a date today at a shuffleboard place called the Royal Palms-- like real full-size shuffleboard. It was a lot of fun :) I wasn't great at it, but it's fine. We also played connect four and then headed to a bar on my street. Love this neighborhood.

01/17/2017

01/18/2017

We recorded Toolsday with Glenn Maddern today. It was so good to hear his perspective on things and the after-recording discussion about CSS was really good. Also just nice to catch up :) Reminds me why I love Toolsday so much.

01/19/2017
---
Today was BrooklynJS! Which was really good. I got to meet Sarah from makeupconf who did a great talk about diagrams in documentation and learning styles. Hanging out afterward was nice too  :)

01/20/2017
---
Went on a second date today with Stepan. We got drinks at Lumos, this small SoHo bar with *great* cocktails, and then went to see a Broadway show, Waitress. Then we went to the Blind Barber (finally made it here) and I ended up getting home at 3:30AM. One of those nights.

01/21/2017
---
Today I went over to John Resig's house with a small group to play board games. It was a lot of fun :) I forgot how much I love to play board games and he made some really good food for us. I left and bought one called Sushi Go on my way home.

01/22/2017
---
There was a Software for Artists Day (like a small conference) at Pioneer Works today. A lot of really cool projects were exhibited! Definitely left feeling inspired and wanting to do more.

01/23/2017
---
Today I did some calligraphy-ing for the crafts and code logo. I'm excited about my future Twitch stream :)

01/24/2017

I got these awesome unicorn makeup brushes in the mail today. Idk if I'll actually use them, but they just make me really happy.

01/25/2017
---
I finally finished setting up service workers for my blog to have offline save capabilities. The post was published today and got a lot of really positive feedback. I'm so glad I finally did this!

01/26/2017
---
DigitalOcean had a company event where they rented out a theatre for us to all watch Hidden Figures at. It was a great event :) So much food though!

01/27/2017
---
After work today we had a happy hour for one of the people temporarily leaving the NYC office. Afterward, I went to see a midnight showing of the Big Lebowski with Pat and Tim. Definitely a fun but unexpected end to the night.

01/28/2017
---
This morning I got breakfast tacos at Tacombi with two of my coworkers who are staying in the corporate housing with me. They're so yumm there and my coworkers are awesome :)

01/29/2017
---
Today I stayed in bed because I'm sick most of the day, but I did watch the Little Prince on Netflix, which is really cute, and beautifully illustrated movie.

01/30/2017
---
I got back into writing my book today which I really need to do. It was good to catch up a bit and infuse some of the work I've been doing on side projects into the writing.

01/31/2017
---
Today I met with Pat to learn about the Photoshop brushes she uses. I got sent a whole pack and have been having a lot of fun experimenting. Also, Kasia had this really rad red/blue pencil that I tried out and

02/01/2017
---
I'm finally feeling pretty good. Sudafed is amazing :) And I went to the gym today to celebrate this fact basically :P and ran/walked a pretty solid workout.

02/02/2017
---
I went to pick up my bag from the corporate apartment and stopped by a book store called McNally Jackson on the way home. There happened to be an event going on and I couldn't help myself from dropping in. I bought a travel book that really spoke to me in the way it was written called "And The Monkey Learned Nothing" and I'm having a hard time putting it down.

02/03/2017
---
Today I was on a panel at STEM night at the New York Hall of Science. It was an event themed around design and engineering for high school and college students, and it was really nice to chat with all of the students and their parents. Afterward I met up with a few people (including Ryan Brownhill who is in town!) for food and drinks, ending the night at Katz's deli again with Tim.

02/04/2017
---
I played Fire Watch with Sam and Tim from start to finish today. The game is so beautiful! And a really enjoyable narrative. Afterward, we got Mexican food, margaritas, and ended up at a karaoke bar singing Lion King songs and Sheryl Crow.

02/05/2017
---
I got brunch at Dudley's with Tim today after watching the Lion King. Completely forgot about how good that movie is! It was a nice morning :)

02/06/2017
---
I went on a run today and it felt *so* good! It was a beautiful view along the west side of Manhattan and I was listening to an amazing audiobook (Love Star) and it was just so good. Afterward, I went and chilled at 61 Local with Tim where there was a really awesome live band (Jess Best), and the staff ended up singing and it was kind-of magical.

02/07/2017
---
I freaking love my purple/pink hair :) I was getting ready for tomorrow's ManhattanJS today and doing errands and I caught myself checking it out in the mirror and felt great. Thank you Amanda!

02/08/2017
---
Tonight was the dressed-up ManhattanJS! It was so much fun and everyone looked so fly. Afterward, a group of us went to karaoke in Korea town and got a bunch of sake and sang a lot and it was a ton of fun. Will do again.

02/09/2017
---
I met up with Sam Phippen at the Dead Rabbit--a really awesome cocktail bar that also has food. The menu was a comic book! And they switch it up regularly as a series! :P I even have a book from this bar with cocktail recipes, so its pretty famous. It was really nice to decompress with him and drink really awesome cocktails. I hope to go back soon.

02/10/2017
---
After work we had the third-biweekly wine tasting. This week's theme was sparkling wine and we tasted 6 and had to pick out the real champagne from the bunch/guess which was which. I got them all wrong :P. I wanted to stay in tonight after going out the past two nights so I stayed in and did calligraphy invites for Liza's wedding. Tim came over later to read a book I recommended to him and to chill, and it was just a nice night in.

02/11/2017
---
I got dinner at this wine bar (Bar Veloce) with Tim--which was super good because when does wine + prosciutto + cheese ever turn out bad? :P Then we went to a comedy show where they read out breakups via text message, and got absinthe after. I ended up stopping by a liquor store and buying chartreuse and absinthe so I have that now :P Doc Henderson's--I'm excited to try it out.

02/12/2017
---
This morning I got breakfast with Tim at Westville which was super good because they had this great veggie market plate, which was a nice healthy wakeup before going to a chocolate-baking competition at the Royal Palms where my roommate, Patricia was competing. That was super fun because a lot of people showed up and we tasted *so* much chocolate. I loved the chocolate babka and chocolate sausage.

02/13/2017
---
I had a really good run today on the west side of Manhattan. It was absolutely freezing out, but I was listening to Wild by Cheryl Strayed and just felt like I could keep going and going. It was such a good feeling despite the weather. Afterward I ordered sashimi and it was great. I'm feeling pretty confident about the running that I'm getting back into.

02/14/2017
---
Today was Valentines day and I spent it sending really weird valentines to my friends and Tim. I also had a trainer appointment with my new personal trainer and it felt *great*. He seems awesome and I'm really looking forward to getting back into gyming much more often.

02/15/2017
---
I saw Tim today. We went to this *amazing* restaurant called Ouiji after Tom Dale's glowing review on Twitter. The restaurant was reviewed by a food writer for the New York Times, and oh my god was it good. We had baby octopus in this beautiful swirled sauce and crispy chicken and a make-your-own mini crepes with seven flavors thing. But my favorite dish was definitely the honey chips with ice cream for desert. Oh my god were they good.

02/16/2017
---
Today was paint night at DigitalOcean :) We got Mexican food and painted angelfish with an instructor. I had a lot of fun doing that. Afterward, I went to 61 Local and met up with a bunch of people for BrooklynJS (a non-ticketed no-talks just-hangs event). It was a good time and I heard a lot of travel stories.

02/17/2017
---
At work I got a DigitalOcean hat and scarf (and socks!). I also met up with Tim afterward to go see the Oscar nominated shorts (I meant to get us tickets to the animated shorts but messed up and got the live-action, which were also great).

02/18/2017
---
Today I woke up super early to fly to Colorado for an annual friend ski trip! I had a nice long drive with Troy to the condo we got on AirBnb and it was so nice to see everyone! We got dinner out and had a few drinks and hung out by the fire :) I fell asleep on the couch because I liked falling asleep by the fire and I stayed up a bit later with Alex and Troy.

02/19/2017
---
Today I went skiing at Keystone. It was rough at first but I got the hang of it after a lot of initial falls. It was amazing to be on the mountain, and it ended up snowing a bit later in the day. Was a pretty magical sight to see so much snow at a ski resort :)

02/20/2017
---
My favorite part of today was snow tubing at Keystone. All 6 of us went snow tubing and it was just a lot of fun. The people there would spin you and you could go in groups up to four people. We did a few runs and it just felt really good to be out there again because I couldn't ski or do much other activity due to my leg.

02/21/2017
---
Today I flew home from Colorado to New York. The flight wasn't too bad, and I slept for most of it.

02/22/2017
---
After I found out about the ACL tear (third confirmation) from an orthopedist here, Tim met me up by where the MRI office was (near Central Park), and he bought me a ukulele to learn since I couldn't run or work out anymore. It was such a sweet gesture. We walked around the park for a bit afterward (and saw a really nice sunset) and then headed to the Buzzfeed tech talk event.

02/23/2017
---
Today I tried playing ukulele for the first time! And I actually was picking it up pretty fast :D I learned to play "Stand by Me" and "Hallelujah" and a bunch of basic chords. I'm really loving the ukulele so far! :D It's been a lot of fun to pick up.

02/24/2017

02/25/2017

Today I rode home for Liza's bachelorette party on Megabus and did a bunch of preparation and planning (including making her gift). Later, after dinner, I pulled out the ukulele and started playing a bit, and then my dad and brother both got guitars out and joined. I ended up learning "In the Jungle" from Lion King and we had a solid 3-hour jam session as a family :) it was great.

02/26/2017
---
Today was Liza's bridal shower! The event went really well. Liza was super happy (and was literally glowing). She loved the games that we played (it seemed like everyone had fun) and really liked the gift I got her too :D. The book Marissa put together was really really cute as well. Liza had a great day, which also made me super happy.

02/27/2017
---
I was walking home from Barnes and Noble today on the street adjacent to mine and realized there are so many awesome little stores and restaurants to still be explored! The neighborhood I moved in to is so cool :) and I can't wait to discover more of it.

02/28/2017
---
Tonight I recorded a really good Toolsday with Chris and did the ukulele intro and it was so much fun and made me happy and I really like playing it :) We also set up a Patreon page to finally get some funding!

03/01/2017
---
I went to Blue Ribbon Sushi today with Tim :) And it was super good not at 2 AM also. We watched American Beauty afterward. A weird but good movie :P It was really nice to hang one last time before we didn't see each other for a while.

03/02/2017
---
I cleaned today and got a bunch done for before Ally comes over. I really like my room :) I think its super cute and I'm excited for Ally to be here.

03/03/2017
---
Today was me and Patricia's house warming! The party went really well -- everyone seemed to have a good time and the drinks Patricia made were insanely good. I got to meet our downstairs neighbor, Patrick, who is really cool! It was good overall :)

03/04/2017
---
I got breakfast at 61 Local with Ally and then we went to this brunch comedy show called Bangers and Mash in the East Village. It was really funny and well done. Then, we went to the Spring Break Art show (which was HUGE) in Midtown and ended the day getting a ton of Japanese BBQ and sake at Myu-Guku in Astor Place. Needless to say we were exhausted by the end of the day and finished it off reading books in bed :)

03/05/2017
---
Me and Ally got brunch at Perla today where I ordered this *really good* dish of brussels sprouts with fried eggs on top and a red sauce and it was just so colorful and yummy. Then we walked around and did a bit of shopping on the west side where I bought 2 new pairs of shoes at this store called Steven which is a Steve Madden experimental store where they only make one pair of shoes in each size. *Then* we met up with Sam to go dress shopping for the DO party in March and met up with Leah for drinks after. The evening ended with Sam getting margaritas and tacos. Another big day.

03/06/2017
---
Today I got such good mail! I got the first Art Snacks box and also a bunch of pens I ordered from Jet Pens (including a DIY multi pen where I picked out all the colors!). I drew on this Muji notebook I had bought with Ally and began to set it up with my travels. its such a perfect notebook! And I experimented with the Art Snacks things :)

03/07/2017
---
Today was full of meetings but good. I feel good that I'm finally getting a chance to do some leading and organizing at work for this consolidated design system. Also realizing how important to-do lists are in my life. They're helping me a ton to get things done.

03/08/2017
---
Today is International Women's Day! Which I adore :) I brought my coworkers flowers and my company did an IWD breakfast and also got us potted tulips/hyacinths to take. It was very cute.

03/09/2017
---
Today I flew to Austin! And Jo picked me up from the airport and we got lunch at Cenote and then went shopping at the Modcloth store after picking up SXSW badges. THEN we picked up her foster, Almond from the vet and hung out at a coffee shop and it was a nice day :)

03/10/2017
---
SXSW day one! I hung out with Jo today. We started out at the Capital One House where they had these *beautiful* new textured credit cards and chatted with the person who designed the experience. We then went to Spredfast and that place was insane--they had these 360 videos where they threw glitter at you and milkshakes with donut toppings. Then, I hung out with Brennen and went to Nat Geo for drinks and then the IBM party where I caught up with everyone.

03/11/2017
---
SXSW today -- I did my mentorship session and saw some really good panels. The morning started off with this New Faces of Creativity panel at the Dell house, which was the second time they had done it (the first was on stage at SXSW, and this smaller venue was super chill and had food). It was also really cool to see one of my favorite modern authors, Cheryl Strayed, being interviewed by Tim Ferris.

03/12/2017
---
Today was so good! SO much happening at SXSW, but the best part was definitely sitting front row at Neil Degrasse Tyson interviewing Ron Howard at the Nat Geo house. It was an amazing experience to see him do a live talk and I'm just so in awe of his communication abilities.

03/13/2017
---
Today was a great day! I went to the trade show at SXSW and that was such a highlight. Lots of VR but also some cool consumer products like this adorable programmable stereo for kids. The day started out hilariously because I had a mixup meeting up with Jo and we ended up at this private Youtube breakfast event. It was great :P

03/14/2017
---
Another great SXSW day. I spent the day with Jo, hanging out by Rainey at this "In Search Of" TBS thing, saw Kesha do a talk, got lunch with a few people and some free avo salad, hung out at the Twitter house with Ian for a bit, then went to Einstein's birthday at Net Geo (amazing drinks omg), and finally met up with Jake Albaugh to try to get into the Wu Tang Clan concert but ended up seeing a different artist that night instead.

03/15/2017
---
I stopped by SXSW today after working a half day and ran into Ian at the Youtube House. They had really good food catered (even though it was kinda crazy to get some) and Jain was playing. The show was *SO GOOD*! I really like her music now that I've discovered it. Really great stop in. And then I met up with Brian and Chris at Chris' place to play Rock Band like old times :)

03/16/2017
---
Today I got dinner with a bunch of friends (8 of us) at this Italian place after spending the day working from one of my favorite coffee shops in East Austin, Cenote :D. It was a great food day. I got the salmon salad at Cenote and then this stuffed quail at the Italian place with sweet potato mash. Great nomz and catch ups.

03/17/2017
---
Today was kind of crazy and serendipitous. I was hanging out with Dan and talking about cameras and then we got Torchy's and Topo and decided to just head to a camera store afterward to take a look. At this camera store, which was *huge* by the way, they just happened to have the camera I had been looking for that someone brought in 3 days ago (used). So I bought it :D It's a very expensive camera but it was a pretty good deal for it. I now have a super awesome Fujifilm x100t!

03/18/2017
---
I got breakfast with Jo and Lauren at Blue Dahlia today :) It was such a good ending to my Austin trip. I love this restaurant and East Austin and it was just a super chill way to spend the morning before my flight. :) Got the frittata as always.

03/19/2017
---
This morning started with a nice, healthy Westville brunch with Tim, and then I ended up hanging out with him at his place while he played Tomb Raider and I worked on an open source project. It was super nice and pretty chill.

03/20/2017
---
I'm obsessed with the new camera I bought in Austin :D ahh it makes me so happy. I definitely spent way too much time today looking up digital photography videos to relearn.

03/21/2017
---
After working late, I ended up meeting up with Harry (who was in town) and Jackie at the Wayland along with TIm and a few other people. It was *so* good to catch up! Ahh! It had been a while. We got Last Word cocktails and I remembered how much I like them :)

03/22/2017
---
There is just so much I had to do this week. Tonight I stayed at home and worked on the Power of CSS talk and painted my nails for the party tomorrow. I actually took my time too, and did a french manicure like I used to do all the time.

03/23/2017
---
Tonight was the DigitalOcean 5 Year Anniversary Party!! It was amazing. The band was super good and they had amazing singers and brass players who went out and danced with us and the company invited basically anyone who's ever worked there and there was sushi during cocktail hour and everyone was all dressed up and I danced a lot :D

03/24/2017
---
I deemed this weekend focus-weekend. So I stayed in and got a lot of work done writing this CSS talk in CSS. I'm pretty stoked about it.

03/25/2017
---
I started the day having a nice brunch with Leah at the Smith. Then, we went to the Strand Bookstore (which is amazing!). I got a cross-stitch kit and the Jim Kay illustrated Harry potter (omg its so good!). Then, I met up with Tim and his friends at a bar where I was introduced to this drink called the Cleanse (so good), and in the evening went to this super small sake bar in his neighborhood and got food there. I tried to stay up with him for F1, and it kind-of worked until F1 actually started.

03/26/2017
---
Today I went right back into work mode. I worked on talk, made pixel art, did some research, organized meeting with people about book review and materials, started a blog post. It was productive AF.

03/27/2017
---
I did a really good recording for Toolsday today :D I'm really into CSS grid lately and was pretty fired up about it. I also made some demos on Codepen using it and shared them and people really liked it.

03/28/2017
---
I'm reading Shoe Dog right now, and its really good. I've been getting really into it during my commute and meals.

03/29/2017
---
I saw this adorable dog on the subway today coming home from work. Oh my gosh. It was such a joy. I smiled at the dog and it stuck its tongue out at me and ahhh! It definitely made my evening.

03/30/2017
---
Today was exciting! I had my first ukulele lesson and session with a new gym trainer. It was like after school activities all over the place :D I also got a salad at this place next door that was super good. I need to explore this neighborhood more. There are so many cute places.

03/31/2017
---
Oh my gosh. Today I saw Harry Potter in concert with Tim at Radio City Music Hall. OH MY GOSH. IT WAS SO COOL! There was a full orchestra that played the score while the movie played in this giant concert hall. I loved it.

04/01/2017
---
April fools day! I definitely had a good April Fools today on Tim when I said the bag outside of his window was gone. His face was amazing. We got brunch at an Aussie place in East Village and hung out with some of his friends before I went home to do some work and pack.

04/02/2017
---
I arrived in Seattle and had a really nice day wandering, taking photos, and relaxing in my *beautiful* hotel room at the Edgewater right on the water (as it sounds). The desk faces the sea and theres this lovely patio and the the weather was so good today. I also went to speaker dinner at the home of one of the event organizers, which was a beautiful spot and a very chill experience.

04/03/2017
---
AEA Day One was today! I got to hang out in the speaker room with everyone and saw some really amazing speakers present. Afterward, a few of us went out to eat in a cute place near the hotel and I came back early, practiced my talk and was asleep by 11. It was nice.

04/04/2017
---
I presented today! And it went really well! And I got positive feedback from a lot of people, including the other speakers, which felt great :) It was the first 60-minute talk I gave and I felt pretty good about it. I'm really happy to be a part of AEA this year.

04/05/2017
---
I flew back from Seattle to New York today. Tim came over to my neighborhood and we got some food at this wine bar called June on the street over from mine. There are so many really cute bars and restaurants around! I really need to start hanging out here more often.

04/06/2017
---
Today I had my trainer session and ukulele lesson! I love Thursdays now :D It's the best day. I love getting toting myself around like a middle schooler getting to activities. Very fun, and I always feel so much better after a workout.

04/07/2017
---
I stayed in tonight and did a *lot* of work on my book. I wrote part of a section on testing and I reorganized the entire book so that it could be reviewed by Sarah later this month. Pretty proud of the work on that.

04/08/2017
---
Today was really good! I saw this movie with Tim and his friends at th Nighthawk (it was about disco in the 80's), and then we got food in the area (Williamsburg) before I headed to a dinner party that my friend Thomas organized. Bunch of stuff, ping ponged around Brooklyn, and it was great.

04/09/2017
---
It finally feels like spring! I got brunch with Tim at the Ugly Duckling down the street, and had a few Aperol Spritz' to celebrate spring. We then met up with more of his friends for Sam's birthday at Jazz BBQ in midtown later. Ate so much good food today and chilled. We ended the evening with a video game at his place.

04/10/2017
---
I love getting hand-written letters. Today I got a note from someone who's podcast I was on, and a rad card to go along with it :) Felt great.

I was out with Tim and his friends today for his friend, Laura's birthday. We hung out outside at this bar called Greenwood Park and I got drunk on cider and sangria on a really beautiful day while hanging out with a lot of awesome people.

I took off a day from work today for a mental health day because of all the stuff I have going on. I'm so glad I did. It felt really good to sleep in and I needed a day to chill and really focus on the talks.

Today after work was a formal friday event and charity raffle. I donated a bunch of money but didn't win anything :P But it was still fun and I enjoyed hanging with people and drinking/eating at the event after the week full of focus.
