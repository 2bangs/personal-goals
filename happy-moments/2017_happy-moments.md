Hello 2017! Today I had brunch with my cousins, played a new board game with them all (makes me think I need to buy more board games), and cleaned all of my makeup brushes. I'm doing this year in review and reseting my goals for the year :) Feeling pretty good about a fresh start and getting my things together after a less-productive end of the year.
