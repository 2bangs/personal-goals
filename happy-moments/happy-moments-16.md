Today was a sick day but at least I got to sleep in! And my presentation portion for G&TT got some positive feedback this round, which is exciting.

I met Leah's roommate today and we went out around her neighborhood on the Lower East Side. It was a lot of fun drunkenly frolicking in the snow on the way home and dancing.

01/23/2016

Today I went out with Leah to a little restaurant called Poko. I didn't intend to drink but they had beet cocktails and the bartender/owner made us amazing Tiramisu dessert cocktails. He also made me grilled octopus salad and her incredible lamb chops! SO Good.

01/25/2016
---
Today I was upgraded to first class (for the first time in my life) on my flight to Austin from JFK! It's so nice! They give you warm towels, snacks, and a warm meal with gelato served on a "table cloth". And real glass for drinks!
