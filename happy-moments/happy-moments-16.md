Today was busy, busy. But I finally figured out our icon system after a ton of researching the options. I presented it today and everyone seemed pretty happy about the solution. Yay for wins!

A group of friends and I played Rock Band today after work. I'm the drummer in our group and I tried out hard mode this time (definitely failed a bit at it) but it was SO MUCH FUN.

Today I went on a first date that I actually really enjoyed (this never happens!). We went on a long walk around Town Lake and I even fixed my bike lock issue! It was both productive and really nice.

Back in the coffee shop grind. I spent the evening at Bennu, one of my favorites, listening to good music (Spotify Discover is on pointe) and drinking almond milk lattes (my go-to beverage).

Today was a sick day but at least I got to sleep in! And my presentation portion for G&TT got some positive feedback this round, which is exciting.

Posted a rant post today about respecting OSS developers. It's getting a lot of shares and I'm glad people are reading and internalizing it.

01/13/2016
---
My speech script for G&TT got approved with good feedback today -- so that's a relief :) finally hearing some good things about it.

I saw Alex again today! We went to an arcade called Pinballz and played DDR and it was *so* awesomely nostalgic. Ahh I had so much fun! And even embarrassingly somehow remembered a few of the moves to one of the songs (Captain Jack).

01/15/2016

I just hung out by myself this Friday and it felt really good to hang out at Bennu coffee and finish up an article that I was having a little trouble with. Just sat down, focused, and whipped it up.

I went mini golfing with Alex today at Peter Pan. It was really cute and then we got some Tex-Mex and hung out on my porch/at my place for the evening. The sun set was pretty awesome today too.

I started listening to the First Fifteen Lives of Harry August at the gym today and it is *so* good I didn't want to turn it off.

01/21/2016

I'm hanging out with the Brooklyn JS crew today at Boroughgramming. What an awesome group of people! It's such a family here. Room is super tight at the meetup, but the vibe is so warm and welcoming.

I met Leah's roommate today and we went out around her neighborhood on the Lower East Side. It was a lot of fun drunkenly frolicking in the snow on the way home and dancing.

01/23/2016
---
OH MY GOSH IT SNOWED SO MUCH. My flight is already canceled for tomorrow. So I stayed in with Leah and we watched movies (a really good one called The Road Within) and then drank wine while watching terrible TV (Married at First Site).

01/24/2016
---
Today I went out with Leah to a little restaurant called Poko. I didn't intend to drink but they had beet cocktails and the bartender/owner made us amazing Tiramisu dessert cocktails. He also made me grilled octopus salad and her incredible lamb chops! SO Good.

01/25/2016
---
Today I was upgraded to first class (for the first time in my life) on my flight to Austin from JFK! It's so nice! They give you warm towels, snacks, and a warm meal with gelato served on a "table cloth". And real glass for drinks!

My first day back was crazy! I woke up to Smashing Magazine having shared one of my blogs before I finished it (recorded audio) so I did that really quickly, then got emails back from publishers and jobs so ahh. So much happened.

01/27/2016
