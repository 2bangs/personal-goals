### Week in Review

The majority of this week was spent in Berlin at Beyond Tellerand. It was such an awesome, inspiring conference and really fun time with old and new friends. I also did a lot of side-projects (posted a new blog, began working on some WebVR work for VR Pong, and did a lot of reading). I also started sketching a typeface that I hope to continue next week, and virtually attended the second day of the Chrome Dev Summit :) On top of that, I dyed my hair and wrote over 6000 words for my book(!) (no details allowed just yet, just in case anyone reads these).

Things are ramping up :) I'll be in New York in 2 weeks. Ahh!
